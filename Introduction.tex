Nature is governed by a few fundamental interactions: the gravitational, electromagnetic, strong and weak interactions. The comprehension of these forces was at the heart of research in Physics throughout the 19th and 20th century. This endeavor led to the two pillars of modern physics. In Einstein's theory of general relativity, gravity is a geometric effect of the topology -- in particular, the curvature -- of spacetime. The three other forces are understood as an exchange of elementary particles (vector gauge bosons or quanta) of their underlying quantum field, as introduced in the Standard Model of particle physics.

Within the framework of the Standard Model, the strong interaction is described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this theory, the \textit{quarks} --- the elementary particles sensitive to this force --- carry a \textit{colour} charge\footnote{This is the analog of the electric charge in QCD.}, that allows the exchange of \textit{gluons}, the vector gauge bosons of QCD. The pecularity of this theory resides in its non-Abelian structure, meaning that gluons themselves are color-charged and therefore can self-interact. The direct consequence of this feature is the running of the QCD coupling constant with the energy scale. In processes involving large momentum transfer (or at short length scale), the coupling constant weakens and the partons -- quarks and gluons -- can be viewed as free particles, leading to asymptotic freedom. Conversely, for lower momentum exchange (or at larger distance, typically of the order of the proton size), the coupling increases forcing partons to be confined inside composite objects, named hadrons, made of two or three valence quarks: the \textit{mesons} and \textit{baryons} respectively. In this regime, QCD calculations can only be achieved via non-perturbative approaches. One of them reveals another compelling feature: Lattice QCD (lQCD) predicts a phase transition from hadronic to partonic matter at extremely high temperature and/or densities; since the partons are deconfined and -- similarly to plasmas -- interact weakly, this state of matter is called the \textit{quark-gluon plasma} (QGP). It is believed to have existed in the primordial Universe, merely a few microseconds after the Big Bang, and could be present in the core of neutron stars. \\

This QGP is not only a concept, it is an experimental fact. Although the first studies date from the 1970's \cite{carruthersQuarkiumBizarreFermi1974}\cite{harringtonHighDensityPhaseTransitions1974}\cite{collinsSuperdenseMatterNeutrons1975}, research on the QGP took off in 2000 with the hint of its existence by the experiments of the CERN (European Organisation for Nuclear Research) heavy ion programm \cite{NewStateMatter2023}. This was validated later with the direct observation of this plasma in 2005 by the experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (Brookhaven National Laboratory) \cite{ludlamHUNTINGQUARKGLUON2005}.

Experimentally, the QGP is recreated in laboratory by colliding heavy nuclei (C, O, Au, Pb,...) at extremely high energies. Due to its fleeting existence of about $10^{-23} s$, the study of this exotic state of matter relies primarly on the observation of the footprints/signatures it left during the collision. The exploration of the QGP also hinges on more elemental collisions, namely proton-nucleus and proton-proton (pp) collisions, where no QGP is foreseen and which are therefore used as baselines. 

Among the various available probes of the QGP, the multi-strange baryons, \rmXi and \rmOmega containing two or three \textit{strange} quarks, appear as the preferred research approach. Being both light and heavy particles, they constitute exotic hadrons abundantly produced in the collision, that provide effective constrains on statistical models. Furthermore, thanks to a characteristic decay topology (cascade), their identification is possible on a vast domain of transverse momentum, originating from different production mechanisms, eventually intertwined. Finally, one key signature signature of the QGP is the \textit{strangeness enhancement}, which consists in the increased yields of strange quarks and thus, in the final state, of strange hadrons. In particular, this enhancement intensifies for hadrons with the largest strangeness content, namely the \rmXi and \rmOmega.\\

Nowadays, the experiment at CERN devoted to studying QCD- and QGP-physics is \textit{A Large Ion Collider Experiment} (ALICE), installed on the ring of the \textit{Large Hadron Collider} (LHC). After two campaigns of data taking in 2009-2013 (Run-1) and 2015-2018 (Run-2), the LHC accelerator has restarted on the 5th of July 2022 for a four-year programm (Run-3) \cite{ThirdRunLarge2023}. During the second long shutdown period of the collider (2018-2022), ALICE has been fully revamped and comes out now as a brand-new experiment: new Inner Tracking System with reduced material budget; improved Time Projection Chamber; installation of a Muon Forward Tracker; upgraded detectors joined with a new Online-Offline software to enable continuous readout of Pb-Pb collisions to interaction rate up to 50 kHz \cite{alicecollaborationUpgradeALICEExperiment2014}. Thanks to these upgrades, the study of QCD- and QGP-physics at LHC enters into a new age, an era of "precision".

About precision, it is enlightening to review the achievements from the previous rounds of data taking, namely LHC Run-1 and Run-2. To a certain extent, they provided measurements to an unprecedented level of precision, especially in the light flavour sector. For instance, we can mention .\\

This thesis proposes pursuing this precision endeavor on multi-strange baryons thanks to the excellent tracking and identification capabilities (at mid-rapidity) of the ALICE experiment in the LHC Run-2. The focus is on pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \sqrtS = 13 \tev. During this three-year PhD spanning from 2020 to 2023, two analyses have been performed; each one will be appropriately introduced and detailed in a dedicated chapter.

The manuscript opens with an introduction on the Standard Model of particle physics.
