\chapter{Identification of V0 particles and cascades}
\label{chap:V0CascReconstruction}
%//-----------------------------------------------------------------------//

The \chap\ref{chap:ParticlePhysics} and \ref{chap:ALICE} have set the scene, it is time for the main actors to come onto stage, namely the (multi-)strange baryons also called \textit{hyperons}\footnote{More precisely, the hyperon family comprises any baryon containing at least one strange quarks, but no heavier quarks such as charm, bottom or top.}. In particular, this chapter lays the foundations for the analysis performed throughout this thesis.

In particular, this chapter of the manuscript establishes the principles of their identification and lays the foundations for the analysis realised in this thesis. 

The first section, \Sec\ref{sec:StrangenessFeatures}, explains what make strangeness -- and most particularly, (multi-)strange baryons -- still so appealing, almost 60 years after their first discovery. The \Sec\ref{sec:HyperonId} introduces some key elements related to the hyperons of interest in the present analyses (\Sec\ref{subsec:V0CascDecays}), as well as the technique employed to identify them; that is, the topological reconstruction (\Sec\ref{subsec:TopoReco}). Finally, in connection with \chap\ref{chap:ALICE}, this small chapter closes on what makes ALICE an appropriate experiment for studying strange hadrons (\Sec\ref{subsec:HyperonAndALICE}).


\section{The appealing features of strangeness}
\label{sec:StrangenessFeatures}

\subsection{The strange quark with respect to the other flavours}

Within nucleons, the strange quark can not be found among the valence quarks, including only up and down quarks. It is present in the sea of quarks (and anti-quarks) and gluons, although in limited amount with respect those produced during a collision at the LHC. Therefore, the strange quark in the final state can only originate from the processes that have occured during the collision.

Quarks can be classified based on whether they preserve (at least, approximatively) or break the chiral symmetry (\Sec\ref{subsubsec:chiralsymmetrybreaking}): the up and down quarks belongs to the first kind and makes part of the light-flavour sector. Those breaking the chiral symmetry -- the charm, bottom and top quarks -- constitute the heavy-flavour sector. For comparison, the bare mass of the up quark sits at $2.16_{-0.26}^{+0.49}$ \mmass, the down quark at $4.67_{-0.17}^{+0.48}$ \mmass. In contrast, the one of the charm, bottom and top quarks lie around $1.27 \pm 0.02$ \gmass, $4.18_{-0.02}^{+0.03}$ \gmass and $172.69 \pm 0.30$ \gmass respectively \cite{particledatagroupReviewParticlePhysics2022}. From this perspective, the strange quark with its bare mass of $93.4_{-3.4}^{8.6}$ \mev holds a unique position: while its lightweight makes it relatively inexpensive to create in terms of energy, it stays still much heavier than up and down quarks. Therefore, being both light and heavy, the strange particle represents an exotic quark abundantly produced in the collision.

\subsection{The specificities of strange hadrons}
\label{subsec:SpecStrangeHadrons}

Once confined within hadrons, the strangeness shows other compelling features. Most of the strange hadrons present a large branching ratio for their decay channel into charged particles. Coupled to a relatively long lifetime --- allowing them to fly over a few centimeters in the detector before the decay ---, this offers the possibility to reconstruct the different strange particles over a wide range of transverse momentum, making use of their distinctive decay topologies known as V0 or cascade \cite{speltzCaracterisationEtatDense2006}. This last point is further developed in the next section, \Sec\ref{subsec:V0CascDecays}.

This allows for a continuous study strange hadrons from low to high \pT. Therefore, they stands as prime choice probes to investigate and improve our understanding on the evolution of the hadronisation mechanisms\footnote{To be exact, it is not the hadronisation mechanisms that evolves with the transverse momentum but rather their relative weight. For instance, soft processes dominates at low \pT, and hard ones at high \pT. However, \textit{a priori}, there are also soft processes at high momentum -- conversely hard processes at low momentum --, although they represent only a small fraction.} with the transverse momentum.

\section{The multi-strange baryon identification}
\label{sec:HyperonId}

On the experimental side, the study of strange particles implicitly requires the ability to identify them. In the context of the thesis, the focus is on multi-strange baryons. Excluding the associated resonances, this leaves five particles: three containing two strange quarks -- the \rmXiZero ($uss$), \rmXiM ($dss$) and \rmAxiP ($\bar{d}\bar{s}\bar{s}$) --, and two triple-strange hadrons namely the \rmOmegaM ($sss$) and \rmAomegaP ($\bar{s}\bar{s}\bar{s}$).

\end{table}

The \tab\ref{tab:V0CascDecay} shows some characteristics of the four charged ones, including their dominant decay channel. These ones are most particularly appealing as they share a common feature that facilitate their identification, they follow a cascade decay topology in their dominant channel as 
mentionned \ref{subsec:SpecStrangeHadrons}.\\


From now on, the following notation will be used. The \rmXiPM (or \rmOmegaPM) refers to \rmXiM or \rmAxiP (or \rmOmegaM or \rmAomegaP). Conversely, \rmXi (or \rmOmega) means \rmXiM and \rmAxiP (or \rmOmegaM and \rmAomegaP). The same goes for other particles. Moreover, the term multi-strange baryon designates only the \rmXiM, \rmAxiP, \rmOmegaM or \rmAomegaP unless indicated otherwise.


\subsection{The V0 and cascade decays}
\label{subsec:V0CascDecays}


The \fig\ref{fig:CascadeDecay} depicts the full cascade decay chain of \rmXi and \rmOmega. After a flight over a few centimeters, the multi-strange baryon decays through weak interaction into a charged pion (or kaon for the \rmOmega) and a \rmLambda. The latter being electrically neutral, only the charged meson deposits energy in the different sensitive layers and be detected at this stage; therefore, the meson plays the role of a \textit{bachelor} particle. Although, the \rmXiPM decays into this channel quasi-systematically, this is only the case for slightly more than 2/3 of the \rmOmegaPM.

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figs/Chapter4/Schema-4TypesDeCascade.eps}
	\caption{Depiction of the full cascade decay chain of the \rmXiM (top left), \rmAxiP (top right), \rmOmegaM (bottom left) and \rmAomegaP (bottom right). Figure taken from \cite{maireFourTypesCascade2011}.}
	\label{fig:CascadeDecay}
\end{figure}

The two decay products continue to travel through the detector, until the baryon daughter decays via weak interaction at 63.9\% into two oppositely charged particles: a proton and a pion. Depending on their electric charge, one is called \textit{positive} and the other \textit{negative}. This decay topology is known as V0\footnote{The term "V0" originates, on one hand, from the V-shape formed by the decay products, and on the other hand, by the neutral charge of the mother.}. Furthermore, the term "cascade" makes reference to the two-steps decay process undergone by the multi-strange particles. In the following, the usage of the term \textit{cascade} may be used to refer either to \rmXi or \rmOmega, and similarly the term \textit{V0} to \rmLambda.

Note that the four cascades on \fig\ref{fig:CascadeDecay} differ only in the nature of the particles involved. On one hand, from the left to right side, the particles are swapped to anti-particles. On the other hand, the larger strangeness content of the \rmOmega imposes the presence of a bachelor particle containing a strange quark (kaon) while, in the \rmXi case, it consists in an light unflavoured meson (pion).\\

The bottom part highlights the cascade decay of a \rmXiM. Figure taken from \cite{alicecollaborationALICEPhysicsPerformance2006}.}
	\label{fig:CascadeDecaySimu}
\end{figure}

The \fig\ref{fig:CascadeDecaySimu} shows the cascade decay of a \rmXiM within the ALICE detector. To make it more apparent, the surrounding tracks have been removed in the bottom left part. The \rmXiPM or \rmOmegaPM being electrically charged, they may loose energy in the detectors and \textit{a priori} be detected. Although they can fly over relatively long distance compared to most of the unstable particles, their \cTau are still too short to \textit{systematically} reach the innermost detectors at about 3.9 \cm and 7.6 \cm (to be compared to \cTau$_{\Xi}$ = 4.91 \cm and \cTau$_{\Omega}$ = 2.461 \cm)\footnote{Note that the detection and tracking of these two multi-strange baryons become possible with the upgraded version of the ITS in the LHC Run-3; the innermost silicon pixel detectors being positioned at a radius of 2.2 \cm and 3.9 \cm in the LHC, the \rmXi and \rmOmega have significantly more chances to leave hits in this detection layers, and therefore to be detected \cite{chinellatoCharmMulticharmBaryon2022}.}. Moreover, the \rmLambda is a neutral particle, hence it can not deposit energy in the sensitive layers. As a consequence, only the cascade decay products can be detected, namely the bachelor particle and the V0 decay daughters.

The top right part of \fig\ref{fig:CascadeDecaySimu} puts into perspective the difficulty of the reconstructing such a cascade topology. While the other part of the figure shows clearly the \rmXi or \rmOmega decay chain, it actually is immersed in a very crowded environment, from which it can not be isolated easily. In order to identify the multi-strange baryons in the event, the strategy followed in the present work consists in using topological reconstruction.

\subsection{The principles of the topological reconstruction}
\label{subsec:TopoReco}

The basic idea behind the cascade identification is to use the reconstructed tracks in the event. Therefore, the association of two tracks allows to build a \rmLambda (or \rmAlambda) candidate, that may in turn be associated to another track (the bachelor) to form a cascade candidate. In a pp collision, the charged particle density\footnote{per unit of pseudo-rapidity} can vary from a few particles up to fifty, and more than a thousands in the most central heavy-ion collisions. The mere association of three tracks may certainly lead to the formation of erroneous candidates, thus constituting a source of \textit{combinatorial} background. In order to suppress the latter, geometric selections -- aimed at singling out the candidates spatially compatible with the expected decay topology -- are introduced; this is the general principle behind topological reconstruction. 

\subsubsection{Formation of the V0 candidates}
\label{subsubsec:V0Formation}

The reconstruction starts with the formation a V0 candidate. The first step consists in identifying \textit{secondary} tracks, that do not originate from the interaction point. They are tagged as such, if the distance of closest approach (DCA) between the considered track and the primary vertex exceeds a critical value\footnote{While one expects for a primary track to have a DCA to the primary vertex equal (or close) to zero, this is the opposite for a secondary track: since it does not originate from the collision point, its DCA to the interaction vertex must necessarily be different from zero.} (\fig\ref{fig:TopologicalRec}, V0.a). 

The second step aims at forming pairs of secondary tracks of opposite charge -- characterised by different curvatures --; by imposing that the DCA between the two tracks is small, only the pairs originating potentially from the same decay point are retained. The secondary vertex is then positioned on the segment defined by the previous DCA, weighted by the tracks quality (\fig\ref{fig:TopologicalRec}, V0.b).

\afterpage{
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering

	\caption{Schematic representation of the different topological selections applied in order to first reconstruct V0s (top part), and then cascades (bottom part). Figure taken from \cite{maireTopologicalSelectionsV02011}.}
	\label{fig:TopologicalRec}
\end{figure}
}

The two daughter tracks are then propagated from their initial position (the point of closest approach to the primary vertex, \Sec\ref{subsubsec:TrackReco}) to the secondary decay point\footnote{Most importantly, here the propagation is performed without taking the energy losses into account. This point will be addressed in \chap\ref{chap:CPTAnalysis}}. This allows to calculate all the kinematic quantities of the V0, among which its momentum; the latter being equal to the sum of the momentum of the positive and negative particles at the secondary vertex, due to momentum conservation.

\subsubsection{The reconstruction of cascade candidates}
\label{subsubsec:CascadeFormation}

From the sample of V0 candidates (\Sec\ref{subsubsec:V0Formation}), only those compatible with a \rmXiPM or \rmOmegaPM decay are considered. In other words, the reconstruction of a cascade candidate must necessarily go through a secondary V0 that corresponds to either a \rmLambda or \rmAlambda.\\

Primary and secondary V0s are separated resorting to the pointing direction in the lab frame, given by the momentum at the decay vertex. This direction coincides with the straight-line trajectory of the candidate\footnote{If the candidate corresponds to an actual \rmLambda or \rmAlambda (electrically neutral), its trajectory, not being curved under the influence of the magnetic field, must necessarily follow a straight line.} and allows to estimate its DCA to the interaction point (\fig\ref{fig:TopologicalRec}, V0.c). The latter being close to zero for primary V0s, a lower cut on this variable enables their rejection and to retain only those tagged as secondary. 

The identification of the V0 goes through the calculation of its invariant mass under  the \rmLambda or \rmAlambda hypothesis. This boils down to making an assumption on the mass of each decay daughter. In the case of a \rmLambda, the positive track corresponds to a proton, the negative to a \piMinus (\eq\ref{eq:LambdaInvMass}); conversely, for a \rmAlambda, they are considered as a \piPlus and an anti-proton respectively. If it turns out that a candidate is, in fact, a true \rmLambda or \rmAlambda, its reconstructed mass should lie within a window of typically a few \mmass\footnote{The width of the mass window depends directly on the transverse momentum resolution of the decay daughters.} (\fig\ref{fig:TopologicalRec}, V0.d), centred around the nominal mass of the \rmLambda ($m_{\Lambda} = 1.115683$ \gmass). In most cases, only one of the two mass hypothesis passes the cut\footnote{The misidentification of the daughter particles usually results in quite different invariant mass.}, making it possible to differentiate between a \rmLambda and a \rmAlambda. 

\begin{align}
M_{\rm candidate}^2(\rmLambda) &= ( E_{\rm pos.} + E_{\rm neg.} )^2 - ( \vec{p}_{\rm pos.} + \vec{p}_{\rm neg.})^2 \\
&= \Big(\sqrt{ \vec{p}_{\rm pos.}^2 + m_{\rm pos.}^2} + \sqrt{ \vec{p}_{\rm neg.}^2 + m_{\rm neg.}^2}\Big)^2 - ( \vec{p}_{\rm pos.} + \vec{p}_{\rm neg.})^2\\
&= \Big(\sqrt{ \vec{p}_{\rm pos.}^2 + m_{p^{+}}^2} + \sqrt{ \vec{p}_{\rm neg.}^2 + m_{\pi^{-}}^2}\Big)^2 - ( \vec{p}_{\rm pos.} + \vec{p}_{\rm neg.})^2 \label{eq:LambdaInvMass}
\end{align}

A last step consists in forming a cascade candidate via the association of a candidate \rmLambda (or \rmAlambda) with any track labelled as secondary\footnote{With the exception of the V0 daughters tracks.} (\fig\ref{fig:TopologicalRec}, Casc.a), playing the role of the bachelor particle. The procedure is analogous to what was done to build a V0 candidate: only pairs with a sufficiently small DCA between the reconstructed \rmLambda (or \rmAlambda) and the bachelor are considered (\fig\ref{fig:TopologicalRec}, Casc.b); primary and cascades are set apart from secondary ones by introducing the \textit{pointing angle}. The latter corresponds to the angle defined by the direction of propagation (or pointing direction) of the candidate, and the line joining the primary and secondary vertices. This angle should be small for a primary candidate and, even though the magnetic field is bending their trajectory, the change in direction remains low. This selection usually goes through the cosine of the pointing angle, that is constrained to be close to unity in order to validate the cascade as primary (\fig\ref{fig:TopologicalRec}, Casc.c).

The V0 candidate is subject to the same cut. Due to its large mass compared to the one of the bachelor, the reconstructed \rmLambda (or \rmAlambda) takes up most of the cascade momentum, and so most of the pointing direction. As a consequence, in order to ensure that the V0 actually originates from a \rmXiPM or \rmOmegaPM decay, the cosine of its pointing angle has to be close to unity.\\

As a final topological selection, the cascade and V0 decay vertices must lie within a certain confidence area, in the transverse plane (\fig\ref{fig:TopologicalRec}, Casc.d). Close to the interaction point, at small radii, the combinatorial background dominates due to the high density of tracks. Conversely, at large distance, the probability of finding a \rmXiPM or \rmOmegaPM becomes extremely low. For comparison, the inner wall of the TPC ($\sim$ 85 \cm) situates at $\sim 18$ $\cTau_{\Xi}$ and $\sim 35$ $\cTau_{\Omega}$. At such distance, the \rmXiPM and \rmOmegaPM survival probabilities are about 2\% and 0.001\%\footnote{Considering a cascade with a momentum of 5 \gmom.} respectively. Therefore, the decay vertices of both cascade and V0 must be located beyond a radius deemed critical; those decaying too far away with respect to their lifetime are rejected.

\subsubsection{Invariant mass of the cascade candidates}

At this stage, the topological reconstruction is over; each triplet of tracks forms a cascade candidate, that can correspond to a \rmXiPM, a \rmOmegaPM or some residual background. This distinction is made based on the invariant mass of each candidate (\eq\ref{eq:CascInvMass}).


\begin{align}
M_{\rm candidate}^2( \textrm{casc.}) &= ( E_{\rm V0} + E_{\rm bach.} )^2 - ( \vec{p}_{\rm V0} + \vec{p}_{\rm bach.})^2 \\
&= \Big(\sqrt{ \vec{p}_{\rm V0}^2 + m_{\rmLambda}^2} + \sqrt{ \vec{p}_{\rm bach.}^2 + m_{\rm bach.}^2}\Big)^2 - ( \vec{p}_{\rm V0} + \vec{p}_{\rm bach.})^2 \label{eq:CascInvMass}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
M_{\rm candidate}^2( \rmXiPM ) &= \Big(\sqrt{ \vec{p}_{\rm V0}^2 + m_{\rmLambdaPM}^2} + \sqrt{ \vec{p}_{\rm bach.}^2 + m_{\pi^{\pm}}^2}\Big)^2 - ( \vec{p}_{\rm V0} + \vec{p}_{\rm bach.})^2 \label{eq:XiInvMass} \\
M_{\rm candidate}^2( \rmOmegaPM ) &= \Big(\sqrt{ \vec{p}_{\rm V0}^2 + m_{\rmLambdaPM}^2} + \sqrt{ \vec{p}_{\rm bach.}^2 + m_{\rm K^{\pm}}^2}\Big)^2 - ( \vec{p}_{\rm V0} + \vec{p}_{\rm bach.})^2 
\label{eq:OmegaInvMass}
\end{align}

For each association of three particles, two invariant masses are calculated: one under the hypothesis of a \rmXiPM candidate (\eq\ref{eq:XiInvMass}), the other for a \rmOmegaPM candidate (\eq\ref{eq:OmegaInvMass}). Notice that, contrarily to the \rmLambda and \rmAlambda cases, the invariant mass is the same for the particle (\rmXiM, \rmOmegaM) and the anti-particle (\rmAxiP, \rmAomegaP). In addition, the masses of the daughter particles involved in \eq\ref{eq:XiInvMass} and \ref{eq:OmegaInvMass} correspond, in fact, to the nominal values from the PDG \cite{particledatagroupReviewParticlePhysics2022}; most importantly, the reconstructed mass of the V0 is not being used here. As long as the latter has been identified as a \rmLambdaPM (\ie its mass fits into a certain tolerance window, \Sec\ref{subsubsec:CascadeFormation}), this choice has the advantage of limiting the deterioration on the cascade invariant mass resolution. \\

Although the invariant mass allows to distinguish a \rmXiPM from a \rmOmegaPM, there exists a region where this is not possible anymore. The \fig\ref{fig:MassXiVsOmega} shows the invariant mass distribution of cascade candidates assuming a \rmOmegaM and \rmXiM. There are two discernible and perpendicular mass bands, each one corresponding to true population of one of two considered species. At their intersection, the two species become indistinguishables, which results in an increased background in this region: a candidate identified as \rmXiM may, in fact, reveal to be a \rmOmegaM, and vice-versa. 

This additional background impacts each kind of cascade in different proportions, though. Since the population of true \rmXiM is much larger than the one of \rmOmegaM\footnote{That is because the \rmXi are typically ten times more produced than the \rmOmega \cite{alicecollaborationProductionLightflavorHadrons2020}.}, the latter constitutes a marginal source of background with respect to the \rmXiM. Conversely, the true \rmXiM -- particularly in the low mass region -- represent a considerable source of background for the \rmOmegaM. As a consequence, in the context of the reconstruction of \rmOmegaPM baryons, any candidates also identified as a \rmXiPM --- that is, with an invariant mass under the assumption of a \rmXiPM within a window of few \mmass around \mPDG\rmXi --- are rejected.

\end{figure}



\subsection{The context of hyperon reconstruction in ALICE}
\label{subsec:HyperonAndALICE}

In view of the characteristics of multi-strange baryons, it appears plainly that their reconstruction require excellent detection capabilities. In that regard, few experiments can compete with the performances of the ALICE detector, at mid-rapidity.

As already outlined in \Sec\ref{subsec:ALICEDetector}, the high granularity of its inner tracker allows to reconstruct the primary vertex, as well as the secondary vertices from V0 and cascade decays, with a precision better than 100 \mum\footnote{Not to mention the resolution on the DCA of the daughter tracks to the primary vertex of about 30 \mum \cite{alicecollaborationPerformanceALICEExperiment2014}.}. Thanks to its large lever arm and almost continuous sampling of the particle trajectory, the TPC 
provides an excellent momentum measurement with a resolution of 0.7\%\footnote{This obviously depends on the track momentum; here this is for \pT = 1 \gmom.} \cite{alicecollaborationALICEPhysicsPerformance2006}, as well as a robust particle identification, on the hyperon's decay daughters. Coupled with its extremely low material budget (13\% \Xzero) and a moderate magnetic field of 0.5 T, the strange hadron reconstruction can be performed over a wide momentum range and particularly, at low \pT, where the most important part of the production is.

Furthermore, the experiment benefits from the high-energy collisions delivered by the LHC. At such energies, hyperons and anti-hyperons are produced in almost equal proportions. All these elements makes ALICE a perfectly suited experiment to study multi-strange baryons. \\

It should be emphasised that the cascade reconstruction varies with the track density, that goes from a few charged particles in pp collisions up to 2000 in the most central Pb-Pb collisions at \sqrtSnn = 5.02 \tev \cite{alicecollaborationCentralityDependenceChargedparticle2016}. In heavy-ion collisions, the enormous amount of tracks means a larger background, but also a larger number of contributor for the primary vertex determination and hence a better resolution on its position. This is in contrast with the pp environment, where the events are less dense but with a poorer quality on the interaction point location. Therefore, the topological selections should be adapted for each environment, as these differences may lead to various biases on the DCA to the primary vertex, pointing angles, etc. 

Also, a compromise has to be made between purity and reconstruction efficiency. In both cases, the key point revolves around the treatement of the background, which depends on the physics analysis. For example, if the background -- or more precisely, its shape -- is known in advance, the latter becomes tolerable as it can be subtracted; thus, one may favour a high efficiency (\ie relatively loose selections). In the reverse situation  where the background is not known, it seems preferable to apply tighter cuts in order to keep a signal with a low level of contamination and thus ensure a high signal purity.
