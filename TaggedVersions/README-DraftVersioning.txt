Scheme to be followed :

        0.x internally to PC,
        1.x interactions with IRC,
        2.x interactions with EB+PB
        3.x for 1st collaboration review
        4.x for 2nd collaboration review + CDS
        (5.x with journal and referees)
        (6.x with collaboration again)
        7.x with second round to referees
        
NB : .tex sources should be copied in order to be able perform latexdiff,
    useful to ease the reviews by PWG, ARC, IRC, collaboration, etc
