Such study allows us to isolate the center-of-mass energy dependence of light-flavour particle production. The measurements reported here cover a \$\$p\_\{\textbackslash text \{T\}\}\$\$ range from 0.1 to 20 \$\$\textbackslash text \{GeV\}/c\$\$ and are done in the rapidity interval \$\$|y|{$<$}0.5\$\$. The \$\$p\_\{\textbackslash text \{T\}\}\$\$-differential particle ratios exhibit an evolution with multiplicity, similar to that observed in pp collisions at \$\$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\}\textbackslash{} =\textbackslash{} 7\textbackslash{} \textbackslash text \{TeV\}\$\$, which is qualitatively described by some of the hydrodynamical and pQCD-inspired models discussed in this paper. Furthermore, the \$\$p\_\{\textbackslash text \{T\}\}\$\$-integrated hadron-to-pion yield ratios measured in pp collisions at two different center-of-mass energies are consistent when compared at similar multiplicities. This also extends to strange and multi-strange hadrons, suggesting that, at LHC energies, particle hadrochemistry scales with particle multiplicity the same way under different collision energies and colliding systems.},

  abstract = {The inclusive production of the {$\psi$}(2S) charmonium state was studied as a function of centrality in p-Pb collisions at the nucleon-nucleon center of mass energy \$\$ \{\textbackslash sqrt\{s\}\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{NN\}\}=5.02 \$\$TeV at the CERN LHC. The measurement was performed with the ALICE detector in the center of mass rapidity ranges -4.46 {$<$} ycms {$<$} -2.96 and 2.03 {$<$} ycms {$<$} 3.53, down to zero transverse momentum, by reconstructing the {$\psi$}(2S) decay to a muon pair. The {$\psi$}(2S) production cross section {$\sigma\psi$}(2S) is presented as a function of the collision centrality, which is estimated through the energy deposited in forward rapidity calorimeters. The relative strength of nuclear effects on the {$\psi$}(2S) and on the corresponding 1S charmonium state J/{$\psi$} is then studied by means of the double ratio of cross sections [{$\sigma\psi$}(2S)/{$\sigma$}J/{$\psi$}]pPb/[{$\sigma\psi$}(2S)/{$\sigma$}J/{$\psi$}]pp between p-Pb and pp collisions, and by the values of the nuclear modification factors for the two charmonium states. The results show a large suppression of {$\psi$}(2S) production relative to the J/{$\psi$} at backward (negative) rapidity, corresponding to the flight direction of the Pb-nucleus, while at forward (positive) rapidity the suppressions of the two states are comparable. Finally, comparisons to results from lower energy experiments and to available theoretical models are presented.},

  abstract = {Two-particle angular correlations were measured in pp collisions at \$\$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\} = 7\$\$~TeV for pions, kaons, protons, and lambdas, for all particle/anti-particle combinations in the pair. Data for mesons exhibit an expected peak dominated by effects associated with mini-jets and are well reproduced by general purpose Monte Carlo generators. However, for baryon\textendash baryon and anti-baryon\textendash anti-baryon pairs, where both particles have the same baryon number, a near-side anti-correlation structure is observed instead of a peak. This effect is interpreted in the context of baryon production mechanisms in the fragmentation process. It currently presents a challenge to Monte Carlo models and its origin remains an open question.},

  abstract = {By colliding heavy nuclei at high energies, which is done at RHIC and the LHC, a strongly interacting Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is created. This manifests itself through several different signatures, which until recently was thought to uniquely probe the QGP. Recently, however, similar signatures have been observed also in small systems, such as pp collisions with high charged-particle multiplicity, which is quite puzzling since a QGP is not expected to be formed in such dilute systems with short lifetimes. One such observable is the enhanced relative yields of multistrange baryons, such as the \$\textbackslash Xi\$ baryon, which has been observed in e.g. Pb-Pb collisions. More recently, this yield enhancement has been observed to scale smoothly with multiplicity also in pp collisions. The main analysis presented in this thesis aims at understanding the production mechanism of strange quarks in pp collisions at \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\}=13\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{TeV\}\$, and in this way reach an explanation of the origin of the strangeness enhancement observed there. This is done by studying angular \$\textbackslash Xi-h\$ correlations, where \$h\$ is either of \$\textbackslash pi\$, K, p, \$\textbackslash Lambda\$, or \$\textbackslash Xi\$ hadrons, by using data from the ALICE detector. The results are compared with four phenomenological models; three flavours of the QCD inspired PYTHIA8 which is based on colour strings, and the core-corona model EPOS LHC. The PYTHIA tunes are the Monash tune, the Junction Mode 0 tune, which has an additional mechanism for baryon formation, and a yet unofficial tune including rope hadronisation, which is a proposed mechanism for the observed strangeness enhancement. In EPOS, the enhanced strangeness is modelled by an increasing fraction of a core that behaves like a medium. The results show that the \$\textbackslash Xi-\textbackslash pi\$ correlation function is dominated by a narrow near-side peak. This is not present in any of the other correlations, which on the other hand have a wide extension in rapidity. This means that pions decouple later in the evolution from the \$\textbackslash Xi\$ baryon compared to the other species, likely within the jet, which was concluded to be due to charge balance, whereas the other correlations are attributed to strangeness and baryon decoupling. In all PYTHIA flavours, strong correlations within the jet are present for all combinations except \$\textbackslash Xi-\textbackslash rm p\$ correlations, meaning that strangeness and baryon number are produced earlier in the evolution in data than in PYTHIA. The junction model however gave a description of the \$\textbackslash Xi-\$baryon correlation that was closer to data than the Monash tune, indicating that the additional baryon mechanism included there is more likely to be correct. For EPOS, on the other hand, the correlation function is very dilute for most species, which was concluded to be due to local conservation of quantum numbers not being properly accounted for. Therefore, it is not yet possible to use this measurement to test the underlying mechanism provided by this model. Based on this, the observations in data indicate that the strangeness production mechanism is likely either due to a core-corona like state, or some hybrid mechanism where string interactions are also important. Correlations were also measured as a function of multiplicity, yielding very similar results across multiplicity classes. Therefore it was concluded that the strangeness and baryon production mechanisms in pp collisions are likely the same regardless of multiplicity},

  abstract = {In this work we explore the possibility to perform ``effective energy'' studies in very high energy collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In particular, we focus on the possibility to measure in \$pp\$ collisions the average charged multiplicity as a function of the effective energy with the ALICE experiment, using its capability to measure the energy of the leading baryons with the Zero Degree Calorimeters. Analyses of this kind have been done at lower centre--of--mass energies and have shown that, once the appropriate kinematic variables are chosen, particle production is characterized by universal properties: no matter the nature of the interacting particles, the final states have identical features. Assuming that this universality picture can be extended to \{\textbackslash it ion--ion\} collisions, as suggested by recent results from RHIC experiments, a novel approach based on the scaling hypothesis for limiting fragmentation has been used to derive the expected charged event multiplicity in \$AA\$ interactions at LHC. This leads to scenarios where the multiplicity is significantly lower compared to most of the predictions from the models currently used to describe high energy \$AA\$ collisions. A mean charged multiplicity of about 1000-2000 per rapidity unit (at \$\textbackslash eta \textbackslash sim 0\$) is expected for the most central \$Pb-Pb\$ collisions at \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\_\{NN\}\} = 5.5 TeV\$.},

We find that uniform states with conventional chiral symmetry breaking have negative pressure with respect to empty space at all but the lowest densities, and are therefore unstable. This is a precisely defined phenomenon which motivates the basic picture of hadrons assumed in the MIT bag model, with nucleons as droplets of chiral symmetry restored phase. At all densities high enough that the chirally symmetric phase fills space, we find that color symmetry is broken by the formation of a {$<$}qq{$>$} condensate of quark Cooper pairs. A plausible ordering scheme leads to a substantial gap in a Lorentz scalar channel involving quarks of two colors, and a much smaller gap in an axial vector channel involving quarks of the third color.},

  abstract = {The yields of the K*(892)\$\^\{0\}\$ and \$\textbackslash Phi\$(1020) resonances are measured in Pb-Pb collisions at \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\_\{\textbackslash rm NN\}\}\$ = 2.76 TeV through their hadronic decays using the ALICE detector. The measurements are performed in multiple centrality intervals at mid-rapidity (|\$y\$|{$<$}0.5) in the transverse-momentum ranges 0.3 {$<$} \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ {$<$} 5 GeV/\$c\$ for the K*(892)\$\^\{0\}\$ and 0.5 {$<$} \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ {$<$} 5 GeV/\$c\$ for the \$\textbackslash Phi\$(1020). The yields of K*(892)\$\^\{0\}\$ are suppressed in central Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp and peripheral Pb-Pb collisions (perhaps due to rescattering of its decay products in the hadronic medium), while the longer lived \$\textbackslash Phi\$(1020) meson is not suppressed. These particles are also used as probes to study the mechanisms of particle production. The shape of the \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ distribution of the \$\textbackslash Phi\$(1020) meson, but not its yield, is reproduced fairly well by hydrodynamic models for central Pb-Pb collisions. In central Pb-Pb collisions at low and intermediate \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$, the p/\$\textbackslash Phi\$(1020) ratio is flat in \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$, while the p/\$\textbackslash pi\$ and \$\textbackslash Phi\$(1020)/\$\textbackslash pi\$ ratios show a pronounced increase and have similar shapes to each other. These results indicate that the shapes of the \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ distributions of these particles in central Pb-Pb collisions are determined predominantly by the particle masses and radial flow. Finally, \$\textbackslash Phi\$(1020) production in Pb-Pb collisions is enhanced, with respect to the yield in pp collisions and the yield of charged pions, by an amount similar to the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$ and \$\textbackslash Xi\$.},

  abstract = {Luminosity determination in ALICE is based on the measurement of visible cross sections in van der Meer (vdM) scans. In the Run 2 (2015{$\surd$}\textendash 2018), the Large Hadron Collider provided proton\textendash proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of s = 13 TeV. One vdM scan per year was performed, which allowed for calibration of the ALICE luminometers: the T0 detector with pseudorapidity coverage 4.6 {$<$} {$\eta$} {$<$} 4.9, -3.3 {$<$} {$\eta$} {$<$} -3.0, and the V0 detector with pseudorapidity coverage 2.8 {$<$} {$\eta$} {$<$} 5.1, -3.7 {$<$} {$\eta$} {$<$} -1.7.

  abstract = {ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16 \texttimes{} 16 \texttimes{} 26 m3 with a total weight of approximately 10 000 t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems each with its own specific technology choice and design constraints, driven both by the physics requirements and the experimental conditions expected at LHC. The most stringent design constraint is to cope with the extreme particle multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad range in momentum, up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC. This will allow for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons, and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei. Most detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for data taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start operation, with the exception of parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010. This paper describes in detail the detector components as installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008.},

  abstract = {The ALICE experiment was proposed in 1993, to study strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities via a comprehensive investigation of nuclear collisions at the LHC. Its physics programme initially focused on the determination of the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of quarks and gluons and was extended along the years, covering a diverse ensemble of observables related to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions. The experiment has studied Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, p-Pb and pp collisions in the multi-TeV energy range, during the Run 1 and Run 2 data taking periods at the LHC (2009-2018). The aim of this review article is to gather and summarise a selection of ALICE physics results and to discuss their implications on the current understanding of the macroscopic and microscopic properties of strongly interacting matter at the highest temperature reached in the laboratory. It will be shown that it is possible to have a quantitative description of the properties of the QGP produced in Pb--Pb collisions. We also show that various features, commonly ascribed to QGP formation, are detected for a wide range of interacting system sizes. Precision measurements of QCD-related observables not directly connected to the study of the QGP will also be discussed. Prospects for future measurements with the ALICE detector and its foreseen upgrades will also be briefly described.},

  abstract = {ALICE is a general-purpose heavy-ion experiment designed to study the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark\textendash gluon plasma in nucleus\textendash nucleus collisions at the LHC. It currently involves more than 900 physicists and senior engineers, from both the nuclear and high-energy physics sectors, from over 90 institutions in about 30 countries. The ALICE detector is designed to cope with the highest particle multiplicities above those anticipated for Pb\textendash Pb collisions (dNch/dy up to 8000) and it will be operational at the start-up of the LHC. In addition to heavy systems, the ALICE Collaboration will study collisions of lower-mass ions, which are a means of varying the energy density, and protons (both pp and pA), which primarily provide reference data for the nucleus\textendash nucleus collisions. In addition, the pp data will allow for a number of genuine pp physics studies. The detailed design of the different detector systems has been laid down in a number of Technical Design Reports issued between mid-1998 and the end of 2004. The experiment is currently under construction and will be ready for data taking with both proton and heavy-ion beams at the start-up of the LHC. Since the comprehensive information on detector and physics performance was last published in the ALICE Technical Proposal in 1996, the detector, as well as simulation, reconstruction and analysis software have undergone significant development. The Physics Performance Report (PPR) provides an updated and comprehensive summary of the performance of the various ALICE subsystems, including updates to the Technical Design Reports, as appropriate. The PPR is divided into two volumes. Volume I, published in 2004 (CERN/LHCC 2003-049, ALICE Collaboration 2004 J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 30 1517\textendash 1763), contains in four chapters a short theoretical overview and an extensive reference list concerning the physics topics of interest to ALICE, the experimental conditions at the LHC, a short summary and update of the subsystem designs, and a description of the offline framework and Monte Carlo event generators. The present volume, Volume II, contains the majority of the information relevant to the physics performance in proton\textendash proton, proton\textendash nucleus, and nucleus\textendash nucleus collisions. Following an introductory overview, Chapter 5 describes the combined detector performance and the event reconstruction procedures, based on detailed simulations of the individual subsystems. Chapter 6 describes the analysis and physics reach for a representative sample of physics observables, from global event characteristics to hard processes.},

During LHC Runs 1 and 2, it has produced a wide range of physics results using all collision systems available at the LHC. In order to best exploit new physics opportunities opening up with the upgraded LHC and new detector technologies, the experiment has undergone a major upgrade during the LHC Long Shutdown 2 (2019-2022). This comprises the move to continuous readout, the complete overhaul of core detectors, as well as a new online event processing farm with a redesigned online-offline software framework. These improvements will allow to record Pb-Pb collisions at rates up to 50 kHz, while ensuring sensitivity for signals without a triggerable signature.},

The ALICE ITS, Inner Tracking System, consists of six cylindrical layers of silicon detectors with three different technologies; in the outward direction: two layers of pixel detectors, two layers each of drift, and strip detectors. The number of parameters to be determined in the spatial alignment of the 2198 sensor modules of the ITS is about 13,000. The target alignment precision is well below 10 micron in some cases (pixels). The sources of alignment information include survey measurements, and the reconstructed tracks from cosmic rays and from proton-proton collisions. The main track-based alignment method uses the Millepede global approach. An iterative local method was developed and used as well. We present the results obtained for the ITS alignment using about 10\^5 charged tracks from cosmic rays that have been collected during summer 2008, with the ALICE solenoidal magnet switched off.},

For the 5\% most central collisions, we measure a value of 1943{$\pm$}54. The rise in dNch/d{$\eta$} as a function of {$\surd$}sNN is steeper than that observed in proton-proton collisions and follows the trend established by measurements at lower energy. The increase of dNch/d{$\eta$} as a function of the average number of participant nucleons, {$\langle$}Npart{$\rangle$}, calculated in a Glauber model, is compared with the previous measurement at {$\surd$}sNN=2.76 TeV. A constant factor of about 1.2 describes the increase in dNch/d{$\eta$} from {$\surd$}sNN=2.76 to 5.02 TeV for all centrality classes, within the measured range of 0\%\textendash 80\% centrality. The results are also compared to models based on different mechanisms for particle production in nuclear collisions.},

  abstract = {Correlations between mean transverse momentum \$[p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}]\$ and anisotropic flow coefficients \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm 2\}\$ or \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm 3\}\$ are measured as a function of centrality in Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions at \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\_\{\textbackslash rm NN\}\} = 5.02\$ TeV and 5.44 TeV, respectively, with ALICE. In addition, the recently proposed higher-order correlation between \$[p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}]\$, \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm 2\}\$, and \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm 3\}\$ is measured for the first time, which shows an anticorrelation for the presented centrality ranges. These measurements are compared with hydrodynamic calculations using IP-Glasma and \$\textbackslash rm T\_\{R\}ENTo\$ initial-state shapes, the former based on the Color Glass Condensate effective theory with gluon saturation, and the latter a parameterized model with nucleons as the relevant degrees of freedom. The data are better described by the IP-Glasma rather than the \$\textbackslash rm T\_\{R\}ENTo\$ based calculations. In particular, Trajectum and JETSCAPE predictions, both based on the \$\textbackslash rm T\_\{R\}ENTo\$ initial state model but with different parameter settings, fail to describe the measurements. As the correlations between \$[p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}]\$ and \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm n\}\$ are mainly driven by the correlations of the size and the shape of the system in the initial state, these new studies pave a novel way to characterize the initial state in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.},

This increase is consistent with that reported by the CMS collaboration for non-single-diffractive events and larger than that found by a number of commonly used models. The multiplicity distribution was measured in different pseudorapidity intervals and studied in terms of KNO variables at both energies. The results are compared to proton-antiproton data and to model predictions.},

  abstract = {At sufficiently high temperature and energy density, nuclear matter undergoes a transition to a phase in which quarks and gluons are not confined: the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) [1]. Such an extreme state of strongly-interacting QCD (Quantum Chromo-Dynamics) matter is produced in the laboratory with high-energy collisions of heavy nuclei, where an enhanced production of strange hadrons is observed [2-6]. Strangeness enhancement, originally proposed as a signature of QGP formation in nuclear collisions [7], is more pronounced for multi-strange baryons. Several effects typical of heavy-ion phenomenology have been observed in high-multiplicity proton-proton (pp) collisions [8,9]. Yet, enhanced production of multi-strange particles has not been reported so far. Here we present the first observation of strangeness enhancement in high-multiplicity pp collisions. We find that the integrated yields of strange and multi-strange particles relative to pions increases significantly with the event charged-particle multiplicity. The measurements are in remarkable agreement with p-Pb collision results [10,11] indicating that the phenomenon is related to the final system created in the collision. In high-multiplicity events strangeness production reaches values similar to those observed in Pb-Pb collisions, where a QGP is formed.},

  abstract = {We report on the first femtoscopic measurement of baryon pairs, such as p-p, p-{$\Lambda$}, and {$\Lambda-\Lambda$}, measured by ALICE at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in proton-proton collisions at {$\surd$}s=7TeV. This study demonstrates the feasibility of such measurements in pp collisions at ultrarelativistic energies. The femtoscopy method is employed to constrain the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions, which are still rather poorly understood. A new method to evaluate the influence of residual correlations induced by the decays of resonances and experimental impurities is hereby presented. The p-p, p-{$\Lambda$}, and {$\Lambda-\Lambda$} correlation functions were fitted simultaneously with the help of a new tool developed specifically for the femtoscopy analysis in small colliding systems: Correlation Analysis Tool using the Schr\"odinger equation (CATS). Within the assumption that in pp collisions the three particle pairs originate from a common source, its radius is found to be equal to r0=1.125{$\pm$}0.018(stat)+0.058-0.035(syst) fm. The sensitivity of the measured p-{$\Lambda$} correlation is tested against different scattering parameters, which are defined by the interaction among the two particles, but the statistics is not sufficient yet to discriminate among different models. The measurement of the {$\Lambda-\Lambda$} correlation function constrains the phase space spanned by the effective range and scattering length of the strong interaction. Discrepancies between the measured scattering parameters and the resulting correlation functions at LHC and RHIC energies are discussed in the context of various models.},

  abstract = {This Letter presents the first experimental evidence of the attractive strong interaction between a proton and a \$\textbackslash phi\$ meson. The result is obtained from two-particle correlations of combined p-\$\textbackslash phi \textbackslash oplus \textbackslash overline\{\textbackslash rm \{p\}\}\$-\$\textbackslash phi\$ pairs measured in high-multiplicity pp collisions at \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\}\textasciitilde =\textasciitilde 13\$ TeV by the ALICE collaboration. The spin-averaged scattering length and effective range of the p-\$\textbackslash phi\$ interaction are extracted from the fully corrected correlation function employing the Lednick\textbackslash 'y-Lyuboshits approach. In particular, the imaginary part of the scattering length vanishes within uncertainties, indicating that inelastic processes do not play a prominent role for the p-\$\textbackslash phi\$ interaction. These data demonstrate that the interaction is dominated by elastic p-\$\textbackslash phi\$ scattering. Furthermore, an analysis employing phenomenological Gaussian- and Yukawa-type potentials is conducted. Under the assumption of the latter, the N-\$\textbackslash phi\$ coupling constant is found to be \$g\_\{\textbackslash rm\{N\}-\textbackslash phi\} = 0.14\textbackslash pm 0.03\textbackslash,(\textbackslash mathrm\{stat.\})\textbackslash pm 0.02\textbackslash,(\textbackslash mathrm\{syst.\})\$. This work provides valuable experimental input to accomplish a self-consistent description of the N-\$\textbackslash phi\$ interaction, which is particularly relevant for the more fundamental studies on partial restoration of chiral symmetry in nuclear medium.},

  abstract = {Antimatter particles such as positrons and antiprotons abound in the cosmos. Much less common are light antinuclei, composed of antiprotons and antineutrons, which can be produced in our galaxy via high-energy cosmic-ray collisions with the interstellar medium or could also originate from the annihilation of the still undiscovered dark-matter particles. On Earth, the only way to produce and study antinuclei with high precision is to create them at high-energy particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Though the properties of elementary antiparticles have been studied in detail, knowledge of the interaction of light antinuclei with matter is rather limited. This work focuses on the determination of the disappearance probability of \textbackslash ahe\textbackslash{} when it encounters matter particles and annihilates or disintegrates. The material of the ALICE detector at the LHC serves as a target to extract the inelastic cross section for \textbackslash ahe\textbackslash{} in the momentum range of \$1.17 \textbackslash leq p {$<$} 10\$ GeV/\$c\$. This inelastic cross section is measured for the first time and is used as an essential input to calculations of the transparency of our galaxy to the propagation of \$\^\{3\}\textbackslash overline\{\textbackslash rm He\}\$ stemming from dark-matter decays and cosmic-ray interactions within the interstellar medium. A transparency of about 50\% is estimated using the GALPROP program for a specific dark-matter profile and a standard set of propagation parameters. For cosmic-ray sources, the obtained transparency with the same propagation scheme varies with increasing \$\^\{3\}\textbackslash overline\{\textbackslash rm He\}\$ momentum from 25\% to 90\%. The absolute uncertainties associated to the \$\^\{3\}\textbackslash overline\{\textbackslash rm He\}\$ inelastic cross section measurements are of the order of 10\%\$-\$15\%. The reported results indicate that \$\^\{3\}\textbackslash overline\{\textbackslash rm He\}\$ nuclei can travel long distances in the galaxy, and can be used to study cosmic-ray interactions and dark-matter decays.},

The proposed programme includes two components: a sample with a target integrated luminosity of about 200 pb-1, for which a highly-selective software-based event skimming will be performed after data reconstruction, and a minimum bias sample with a target integrated luminosity of about 3 pb-1. The first sample targets several physics topics based on the selection of rare events, in particular with very high particle multiplicity or diffractive topologies, and/or rare signals, ranging from light nuclei and hyperons to heavy-quark hadrons and jets. The data processing and selection strategy exploits the new online-offline computing framework that is being prepared to process the Pb-Pb data samples. The second sample will be recorded with a reduced value of the ALICE solenoid magnetic field (0.2 T) and will be devoted to high-precision studies of low-mass dielectron pairs.},

In order to avoid auto-correlation biases, the actual transverse momentum (\$p\_\{\textbackslash rm\{T\}\}\$) spectra of the particles under study and the event activity are measured in different rapidity windows. In the highest multiplicity class, the charged-particle density reaches about 3.5 times the value measured in inelastic collisions. While the yield of protons normalized to pions remains approximately constant as a function of multiplicity, the corresponding ratios of strange hadrons to pions show a significant enhancement that increases with increasing strangeness content. Furthermore, all identified particle to pion ratios are shown to depend solely on charged-particle multiplicity density, regardless of system type and collision energy. The evolution of the spectral shapes with multiplicity and hadron mass shows patterns that are similar to those observed in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies. The obtained \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm\{T\}\}\$ distributions and yields are compared to expectations from QCD-based pp event generators as well as to predictions from thermal and hydrodynamic models. These comparisons indicate that traces of a collective, equilibrated system are already present in high-multiplicity pp collisions.},

Possible auto-correlations between the charged particles and the strange hadrons are evaluated by measuring the event-activity with charged particle multiplicity estimators covering different pseudorapidity regions. When comparing to lower energy results, the yields of strange hadrons are found to depend only on the mid-rapidity charged particle multiplicity. Several features of the data are reproduced qualitatively by general purpose QCD Monte Carlo models that take into account the effect of densely-packed QCD strings in high multiplicity collisions. However, none of the tested models reproduce the data quantitatively. This work corroborates and extends the ALICE findings on strangeness production in proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV.},

The data are presented for central and peripheral collisions, corresponding to 0-5\% and 70-80\% of the hadronic Pb-Pb cross section.

The comparison is expressed in terms of the nuclear modification factor \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm AA\}\$. The result indicates only weak medium effects (\$R\_\{\textbackslash rm AA\} \textbackslash approx \$ 0.7) in peripheral collisions. In central collisions, \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm AA\}\$ reaches a minimum of about 0.14 at \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}=6\$-7GeV/\$c\$ and increases significantly at larger \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$. The measured suppression of high-\$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ particles is stronger than that observed at lower collision energies, indicating that a very dense medium is formed in central Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC.},

In the most central Au+Au collisions at the highest beam energy, evidence is found for the formation of a very high energy density system whose description in terms of simple hadronic degrees of freedom is inappropriate. Furthermore, the constituents of this novel system are found to undergo a significant level of interaction. The properties of particle production at RHIC energies are shown to follow a number of simple scaling behaviors, some of which continue trends found at lower energies or in simpler systems. As a function of centrality, the total number of charged particles scales with the number of participating nucleons. When comparing Au+Au at different centralities, the dependence of the yield on the number of participants at higher pT (\textasciitilde 4 GeV/c) is very similar to that at low transverse momentum. The measured values of charged particle pseudorapidity density and elliptic flow were found to be independent of energy over a broad range of pseudorapidities when effectively viewed in the rest frame of one of the colliding nuclei, a property we describe as "extended longitudinal scaling''. Finally, the centrality and energy dependences of several observables were found to factorize to a surprising degree.},

  abstract = {The theory governing the strong nuclear force, Quantum Chromodynamics, predicts that at sufficiently high energy densities hadronic nuclear matter undergoes a deconfinement transition to a new phase of quarks and gluons. Although this has been observed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, it is currently an open question whether quark matter exists inside neutron stars. By combining astrophysical observations and theoretical ab-initio calculations in a model-independent way, we find that the inferred properties of matter in the cores of neutron stars with mass corresponding to 1.4 solar masses are compatible with nuclear model calculations. However, the matter in the interior of maximally massive, stable neutron stars exhibits characteristics of the deconfined phase, which we interpret as evidence for the presence of quark-matter cores. For the heaviest reliably observed neutron stars with masses of about two solar masses, the presence of quark matter is found to be linked to the behaviour of the speed of sound c\_s in strongly interacting matter. If the conformal bound (c\_s)\^2 {$<$} 1/3 is not strongly violated, massive neutron stars are predicted to have sizable quark-matter cores. This finding has important implications for the phenomenology of neutron stars, and affects the dynamics of neutron star mergers with at least one sufficiently massive participant.},

The parton-shower approach is used to simulate initial- and final-state QCD radiation, including colour coherence effects, with special emphasis on the correct description of radiation from heavy particles. The underlying event is simulated using an eikonal multiple parton-parton scattering model. The formation of hadrons from the quarks and gluons produced in the parton shower is described using the cluster hadronization model.

Due to its transience (lifetime\,\textasciitilde\,10-23\,s) and microscopic size (10-14\,m), the QGP cannot be observed directly, but only through the particles it emits; however, its characteristics can be inferred by matching the output of computational collision models to experimental observations. Previous work, using viscous relativistic hydrodynamics to simulate QGP, has achieved semiquantitative constraints on key physical properties, such as its specific shear and bulk viscosity, but with large, poorly defined uncertainties2\textendash 8. Here, we present the most precise estimates so far of QGP properties, including their quantitative uncertainties. By applying established Bayesian parameter estimation methods9 to a dynamical collision model and a wide variety of experimental data, we extract estimates of the temperature-dependent specific shear and bulk viscosity simultaneously with related initial-condition properties. The method is extensible to other collision models and experimental data and may be used to characterize additional aspects of high-energy nuclear collisions.},

  abstract = {I develop and apply a Bayesian method for quantitatively estimating properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), an extremely hot and dense state of fluid-like matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The QGP cannot be directly observed -- it is extraordinarily tiny and ephemeral, about \$10\^\{-14\}\$ meters in size and living \$10\^\{-23\}\$ seconds before freezing into discrete particles -- but it can be indirectly characterized by matching the output of a computational collision model to experimental observations. The model, which takes the QGP properties of interest as input parameters, is calibrated to fit the experimental data, thereby extracting a posterior probability distribution for the parameters. In this dissertation, I construct a specific computational model of heavy-ion collisions and formulate the Bayesian parameter estimation method, which is based on general statistical techniques. I then apply these tools to estimate fundamental QGP properties, including its key transport coefficients and characteristics of the initial state of heavy-ion collisions. Perhaps most notably, I report the most precise estimate to date of the temperature-dependent specific shear viscosity \$\textbackslash eta/s\$, the measurement of which is a primary goal of heavy-ion physics. The estimated minimum value is \$\textbackslash eta/s = 0.085\_\{-0.025\}\^\{+0.026\}\$ (posterior median and 90\% uncertainty), remarkably close to the conjectured lower bound of \$1/4\textbackslash pi \textbackslash simeq 0.08\$. The analysis also shows that \$\textbackslash eta/s\$ likely increases slowly as a function of temperature. Other estimated quantities include the temperature-dependent bulk viscosity \$\textbackslash zeta/s\$, the scaling of initial state entropy deposition, and the duration of the pre-equilibrium stage that precedes QGP formation.},

  abstract = {We present a new model for building up complete exclusive hadronic final states in high energy nucleus collisions. It is a direct extrapolation of high energy pp collisions (as described by PYTHIA), and thus bridges a large part of the existing gap between heavy ion and high energy physics phenomenology. The model is inspired by the old Fritiof model and the notion of wounded nucleons. Two essential features are the treatment of multi-parton interactions and diffractive excitation in each NN sub-collision. Diffractive excitation is related to fluctuations in the nucleon partonic sub-structure, and fluctuations in both projectile and target are here included for the first time. The model is able to give a good description of general final-state properties such as multiplicity and transverse momentum distributions, both in pA and AA collisions. The model can therefore serve as a baseline for understanding the non-collective background to observables sensitive to collective behaviour. As PYTHIA does not include a mechanism to reproduce the collective effects seen in pp collisions, such effects are also not reproduced by the present version of Angantyr. Effects of high string density, shown to be able to reproduce e.g. higher strangeness ratios and the ridge in pp, will be added in future studies},

The program is most often used to generate high-energy-physics collision "events", i.e. sets of particles produced in association with the collision of two incoming high-energy particles, but has several uses beyond that. The guiding philosophy is to produce and reproduce properties of experimentally obtained collisions as accurately as possible. The program includes a wide ranges of reactions within and beyond the Standard Model, and extending to heavy ion physics. Emphasis is put on phenomena where strong interactions play a major role. The manual contains both pedagogical and practical components. All included physics models are described in enough detail to allow the user to obtain a cursory overview of used assumptions and approximations, enabling an informed evaluation of the program output. A number of the most central algorithms are described in enough detail that the main results of the program can be reproduced independently, allowing further development of existing models or the addition of new ones. Finally, a chapter dedicated fully to the user is included towards the end, providing pedagogical examples of standard use cases, and a detailed description of a number of external interfaces.

Both models show a clear baryon enhancement with increasing multiplicity, while only the DIPSY rope model leads to a strangeness enhancement. Flow-like patterns, previously found to be connected to colour reconnection models, are investigated for the new models.

  abstract = {In models for hadron collisions based on string hadronization, the strings are usually treated as independent, allowing no interaction between the confined colour fields. In studies of nucleus collisions it has been suggested that strings close in space can fuse to form "colour ropes". Such ropes are expected to give more strange particles and baryons, which also has been suggested as a signal for plasma formation. Overlapping strings can also be expected in pp collisions, where usually no phase transition is expected. In particular at the high LHC energies the expected density of strings is quite high. To investigate possible effects of rope formation, we present a model in which strings are allowed to combine into higher multiplets, giving rise to increased production of baryons and strangeness, or recombine into singlet structures and vanish. Also a crude model for strings recombining into junction structures is considered, again giving rise to increased baryon production. The models are implemented in the DIPSY MC event generator, using PYTHIA 8 for hadronization, and comparison to pp minimum bias data, reveals improvement in the description of identified particle spectra.},

Both these models are implemented within the general-purpose Monte Carlo event generator Pythia, which makes the matching reasonably straightforward, and allows for detailed studies of the full space--time evolution. The rescattering rate is significantly higher than in pp, especially for central AA collisions, where the typical primary hadron rescatters several times. We study the impact of rescattering on a number of distributions, such as pT and eta spectra, and the space--time evolution of the whole collision process. Notably rescattering is shown to give a significant contribution to elliptic flow in XeXe and PbPb, and to give a nontrivial impact on charm production.},

  abstract = {Based on the recent success of the \textbackslash angantyr model in describing multiplicity distributions of the hadronic final state in high energy heavy ion collisions, we investigate how far one can go with a such a string-based scenario to describe also flow effects measured in such collisions. For this purpose we improve our previous so-called \textbackslash textit\{shoving\} model, where strings that are close in space--time tend to repel each other in a way that could generate anisotropic flow, and we find that this model can indeed generate such flows in \textbackslash AA\textbackslash{} collisions. The flow generated is not quite enough to reproduce measurements, but we identify some short-comings in the presented implementation of the model that, when fixed, could plausibly give a more realistic amount of flow.},

Nella tesi viene anche descritto in dettaglio lo studio sulle incertezze sistematiche.

Guided by the experimental needs and requirements, we highlight areas of active development, and opportunities for future improvements. Particular emphasis is given to physics models and algorithms that are employed across a variety of experiments. These common themes in event generator development lead to a more comprehensive understanding of physics at the highest energies and intensities, and allow models to be tested against a wealth of data that have been accumulated over the past decades. A cohesive approach to event generator development will allow these models to be further improved and systematic uncertainties to be reduced, directly contributing to future experimental success. Event generators are part of a much larger ecosystem of computational tools. They typically involve a number of unknown model parameters that must be tuned to experimental data, while maintaining the integrity of the underlying physics models. Making both these data, and the analyses with which they have been obtained accessible to future users is an essential aspect of open science and data preservation. It ensures the consistency of physics models across a variety of experiments.},

It currently includes more than 900 physicists and senior engineers, from both nuclear and high-energy physics, from about 80 institutions in 28 countries. The experiment was approved in February 1997. The detailed design of the different detector systems has been laid down in a number of Technical Design Reports issued between mid-1998 and the end of 2001 and construction has started for most detectors. Since the last comprehensive information on detector and physics performance was published in the ALICE Technical Proposal in 1996, the detector as well as simulation, reconstruction and analysis software have undergone significant development. The Physics Performance Report (PPR) will give an updated and comprehensive summary of the current status and performance of the various ALICE subsystems, including updates to the Technical Design Reports, where appropriate, as well as a description of systems which have not been published in a Technical Design Report. The PPR will be published in two volumes. The current Volume I contains: a short theoretical overview and an extensive reference list concerning the physics topics of interest to ALICE, relevant experimental conditions at the LHC, a short summary and update of the subsystem designs, and a description of the offline framework and Monte Carlo generators. Volume II, which will be published separately, will contain detailed simulations of combined detector performance, event reconstruction, and analysis of a representative sample of relevant physics observables from global event characteristics to hard processes.},

  abstract = {Geneva, 14 March 2013. At the Moriond Conference today, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at CERN1's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) presented preliminary new results that further elucidate the particle discovered last year.~ Having analysed two and a half times more data than was available for the discovery announcement in July, they find that the new particle is looking more and more like a Higgs boson, the particle linked to the mechanism that gives mass to elementary particles. It remains an open question, however, whether this is the Higgs boson of the Standard Model of particle physics, or possibly the lightest of several bosons predicted in some theories that go beyond the Standard Model. Finding the answer to this question will take time. Whether or not it is a Higgs boson is demonstrated by how it interacts with other particles, and its quantum properties. For example, a Higgs boson is postulated to have spin 0, and in the Standard Model its parity \textendash{} a measure of how its mirror image behaves \textendash{} should be positive. CMS and ATLAS have compared a number of options for the spin-parity of this particle, and these all prefer no spin and positive parity. This, coupled with the measured interactions of the new particle with other particles, strongly indicates that it is a Higgs boson. ``The preliminary results with the full 2012 data set are magnificent and to me it is clear that we are dealing with a Higgs boson though we still have a long way to go to know what kind of Higgs boson it is.'' said CMS spokesperson Joe Incandela. "The beautiful new results represent a huge effort by many dedicated people. They point to the new particle having the spin-parity of a Higgs boson as in the Standard Model. We are now well started on the measurement programme in the Higgs sector," said ATLAS spokesperson Dave Charlton. To determine if this is the Standard Model Higgs boson, the collaborations have, for example, to measure precisely the rate at which the boson decays into other particles and compare the results to the predictions. The detection of the boson is a very rare event - it takes around 1 trillion (1012) proton-proton collisions for each observed event. To characterize all of the decay modes will require much more data from the LHC. 1. CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is the world's leading laboratory for particle physics.

  abstract = {We present a new method for detection of multiply charmed baryons via their decays into strange baryons, using `strangeness tracking'. This method makes use of the state-of-the-art upgraded silicon detectors in ALICE during Runs 3, 4 and beyond will enable the novel possibility of tracking strange hadrons directly before they decay, leading to a very significant improvement in impact-parameter resolution. In this work, we will discuss how this new technique will be crucial to distinguish secondary strange baryons originating from charm decays from primary strange baryons. This is a particularly interesting possibility for the \$\textbackslash Omega\^\{-\}\$ baryon coming from \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm\{c\}\}\^\{0\}\textbackslash rightarrow\textbackslash Omega\^\{-\}\textbackslash pi\^\{+\}\$ decays, since there is no other relevant feeddown source for \$\textbackslash Omega\^\{-\}\$. This, in turn, means that the main \$\textbackslash Omega\^\{-\}\$ background for the \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm\{c\}\}\$ measurement will point most accurately to the primary vertex, unlike pions or protons from other charm baryon decays. We will illustrate the achievable performance of strangeness tracking for the Run 3 configuration of ALICE with the upgraded Inner Tracking System, which is fully instrumented with silicon pixel detectors. Moreover, we will discuss the potential of this technique in a future experiment with an extensive silicon tracking detector with a first layer very close to the interaction point. Finally, we will also cover other potential major applications of strangeness tracking, including measurements of hypernuclei such as the \$\^\{3\}\_\{\textbackslash Lambda\}\textbackslash rm\{H\}\$.},

  abstract = {The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 1034 cm-2 s-1 (1027 cm-2 s-1). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4{$\pi$} solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|{$\eta$}| {$\leqslant$} 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.},

  abstract = {The second-order azimuthal anisotropy Fourier harmonics, v2, are obtained in pPb and PbPb collisions over a wide pseudorapidity (eta) range based on correlations among six or more charged particles. The pPb data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 inverse nanobarns, were collected during the 2013 LHC pPb run at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV by the CMS experiment. A sample of semi-peripheral PbPb collision data at sqrt(s[NN])= 2.76 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.5 inverse microbarns and covering a similar range of particle multiplicities as the pPb data, is also analyzed for comparison. The six- and eight-particle cumulant and the Lee-Yang zeros methods are used to extract the v2 coefficients, extending previous studies of two- and four-particle correlations. For both the pPb and PbPb systems, the v2 values obtained with correlations among more than four particles are consistent with previously published four-particle results. These data support the interpretation of a collective origin for the previously observed long-range (large Delta[eta]) correlations in both systems. The ratios of v2 values corresponding to correlations including different numbers of particles are compared to theoretical predictions that assume a hydrodynamic behavior of a pPb system dominated by fluctuations in the positions of participant nucleons. These results provide new insights into the multi-particle dynamics of collision systems with a very small overlapping region.},

Short-range correlations in Delta(eta), which are studied in minimum bias events, are characterized using a simple "independent cluster" parametrization in order to quantify their strength (cluster size) and their extent in eta (cluster decay width). Long-range azimuthal correlations are studied differentially as a function of charged particle multiplicity and particle transverse momentum using a 980 inverse nb data set at 7 TeV. In high multiplicity events, a pronounced structure emerges in the two-dimensional correlation function for particle pairs with intermediate transverse momentum of 1-3 GeV/c, 2.0{$<$} |Delta(eta)| {$<$}4.8 and Delta(phi) near 0. This is the first observation of such a long-range, near-side feature in two-particle correlation functions in pp or p p-bar collisions.},

The necessary tools - perturbation theory, the renormalization group, gauge theories, and the operator product expansion - are not new. To anyone familiar with these field theoretic approaches to strong interactions, the novel feature is a simple fact: there is a unique class of theories in which ``the origin is an ultraviolet fixed point''. But the consequences are so exciting that it seemed appropriate to review these ideas as they reflect on each other. Many important applications of the renormalization group and the operator product expansion to hadronic physics are omitted; the emphasis here is on recent work based on asymptotically free field theories. No doubt, there are some developments so recent that they are not treated in this article. The discussion of the basic results concerning short distance behavior is informal, but, hopefully, accurate and complete. The specific applications are treated in varying detail.},

The dependence of \$\textbackslash alpha\_s(Q\^2)\$ on momentum transfer \$Q\$ encodes the underlying dynamics of hadron physics -from color confinement in the infrared domain to asymptotic freedom at short distances. We review constraints on \$\textbackslash alpha\_s(Q\^2)\$ at high \$Q\^2\$, as predicted by perturbative QCD, and its analytic behavior at small \$Q\^2\$, based on models of nonperturbative dynamics. In the introductory part of this review, we explain the phenomenological meaning of \$\textbackslash alpha\_s\$, the reason for its running, and the challenges facing a complete understanding of its analytic behavior in the infrared domain. In the second, more technical, part of the review, we discuss the behavior of \$\textbackslash alpha\_s(Q\^2)\$ in the high \$Q\^2\$ domain of QCD. We review how \$\textbackslash alpha\_s\$ is defined, including its renormalization scheme dependence, the definition of its renormalization scale, the utility of effective charges, as well as Commensurate Scale Relations which connect the various definitions of \$\textbackslash alpha\_s\$ without renormalization-scale ambiguity. We also report recent measurements and theoretical analyses which have led to precise QCD predictions at high energy. In the last part of the review, we discuss the challenge of understanding the analytic behavior \$\textbackslash alpha\_s(Q\^2)\$ in the infrared domain. We also review important methods for computing \$\textbackslash alpha\_s\$, including lattice QCD, the Schwinger-Dyson equations, the Gribov-Zwanziger analysis and light-front holographic QCD. After describing these approaches and enumerating their conflicting predictions, we discuss the origin of these discrepancies and how to remedy them. Our aim is not only to review the advances in this difficult area, but also to suggest what could be an optimal definition of \$\textbackslash alpha\_s\$ in order to bring better unity to the subject.},

Total particle production rates exceed predictions by models that use Perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD). In particular, we compare our measurements to predictions by the PYTHIA event generator and find that predictions agree with data only at transverse momenta (pt) higher than \$6-7\textasciitilde GeV/c\$. This result indicates that the leading order processes implemented in PYTHIA are well adjusted, but the implementation of a calculation that describes the data at low \$p\_\{t\}\$ is still an open issue. The results presented here should contribute to improve our understanding of particle production mechanisms at low \$p\_\{t\}\$. Proton-proton collisions are also used as a reference for nuclear collisions of different multiplicities in the study of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formation. The increase of strangeness production is considered an important observable of the QGP. In this context, we study the dependence of strange particle production with charged particle multiplicity and find that there is no indication of an increase strangeness production rate in pp collisions. This is an important result that contributes to the studies that consider the possibility of QGP formation in pp collisions. ￼},

@phdthesis{fagginMeasurementHeavyflavourDecay2021,
  title = {Measurement of Heavy-Flavour Decay Electrons and Heavy-Flavour Baryon Production with {{ALICE}} Experiment at {{LHC}}},
  author = {Faggin, Mattia},
  year = {2021},
  abstract = {The ALICE experiment at the LHC at CERN is devoted to the study of collisions of heavy nuclei accelerated at ultra-relativistic energies. These collisions are employed to reproduce in laboratory the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of the strongly-interacting matter. The existence of this state is predicted by the QCD theory under extreme conditions of energy-density and temperature. The QGP is supposed to constitute the early universe in the first \$\textbackslash sim 10\$ \$\textbackslash mu\$s after the Big Bang. Charm and beauty quarks are unique probes for investigating the QGP. Given a mass of the GeV order, they are produced in the hard-scattering processes in the early stages of the nucleus-nucleus collision, experiencing the full evolution of the system. Charm and beauty quarks lose energy by interacting with the plasma constituents. These phenomena can be studied by measuring the heavy-flavour hadron production and exploited to infer properties of the system. In this thesis, the production of electrons from charm and beauty hadron decays in central (0-10\%), semicentral (30-50\%) and peripheral (60-80\%) Pb-Pb collisions at \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\_\{\textbackslash rm NN\}\}=5.02\$ TeV measured with the ALICE experiment is presented. These results are compared with those in pp collisions by means of the nuclear modification factor (\$R\_\{\textbackslash rm AA\}\$) and a significant suppression with respect to what expected in absence of a deconfined medium is observed in central and semicentral events. This behaviour indicates that charm and beauty quarks are subject to in-medium energy loss. The observed effect decreases in more peripheral events. The measurement is pushed down to \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\^\{\textbackslash rm e\^-\}=500\$ MeV/\$c\$, where the heavy quark production is sensitive to the shadowing effects. The \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm AA\}\$ does not overcome unity, signalling that the production of heavy-flavour hadrons is suppressed. The QGP formation in heavy-ion collisions is expected to induce a modification of the heavy quark hadronisation mechanisms. In order to disentangle the effects of the medium produced in Pb-Pb collisions, a deep comprehension of the mechanisms that govern the hadronisation in pp collisions is required. Recent results on baryon-to-meson production ratios in pp collisions at the LHC showed an enhancement with respect to \$\textbackslash rm e\^+e\^-\$ and \$\textbackslash rm e\^-p\$ collisions. In this thesis, the measurement of the \$\textbackslash Lambda\_\{\textbackslash rm c\}\^\{+\}\$ and \$\textbackslash Sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm c\}\^\{0.++\}\$ baryon production cross section in pp collisions at \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\}=13\$ TeV with the ALICE experiment is described. The ratio to the \$\textbackslash rm D\^\{0\}\$ meson production of both baryons is significantly higher than what measured in \$\textbackslash rm e\^+e\^-\$ and \$\textbackslash rm e\^-p\$ collisions. The measurements are described by several model calculations assuming different mechanisms for the charm quark hadronisation. Moreover, the first measurement of the prompt \$\textbackslash Lambda\_\{\textbackslash rm c\}\^\{+\}\$ feed-down from \$\textbackslash Sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm c\}\^\{0,+,++\}\$ decays in pp collisions is presented and observed to be \$\textbackslash sim 2\$ times larger than \$\textbackslash rm e\^+e\^-\$ collisions in the interval \$2 {$<$} p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\} {$<$} 12\$ GeV/\$c\$. The investigation of the charm quark hadronisation mechanisms in hadronic collisions can significantly benefit from production measurements of more charm baryons. In the last Chapter, a few studies on the capabilities to perform such measurements in the future with the ALICE experiment are discussed. New frontiers in the heavy-flavour hadron production measurements will be allowed by the significantly higher statistics that the experiment will collect in the upcoming years, as well as the improved pointing resolution provided by the upgraded ITS detector},

Firstly, most theoretical inventions are based on analysis of simple collisions, in which only a small number of particles come out. But it is at once realized that questions of unitarity, the asymptotic behavior for high energy in dispersion integrals, etc, require some ansatz be made for the higher energy collisions, in order to close the infinite hierarchy of equations which result. Secondly, experiments at high energies usually yield many particles, and only by selecting the rare collision can we find those about which the theorist has been speaking. For the highly multiple inelastic collisions (to which the major part of the inelastic cross section is due) so many variables are involved that it is not known how to organize or present this data. Any theoretical suggestion (even if it proves to be not quite right) suggests a way that this vast amount of data may be analyzed. For this reason I shall present here some preliminary speculations on how these collisions might behave even though I have not yet analyzed them as fully as I would like.},

In this article we study a few possible modifications to the Pythia event generator, which describes a wealth of data but fails for a number of recent observations. Firstly, we present a new model for generating the transverse momentum of hadrons during the string fragmentation process, inspired by thermodynamics, where heavier hadrons naturally are suppressed in rate but obtain a higher average transverse momentum. Secondly, close-packing of strings is taken into account by making the temperature or string tension environment-dependent. Thirdly, a simple model for hadron rescattering is added. The effect of these modifications is studied, individually and taken together, and compared with data mainly from the LHC. While some improvements can be noted, it turns out to be nontrivial to obtain effects as big as required, and further work is called for.},

The symmetry violation is sscribed phenomenologically to the mass differences. The baryons correspond to an eight-dimensional irreducible representation of the unitary group. The pion and K meson fit into a similar set of eight particles along with a predicted pseudoscalar meson X/sup o/ having I = 0. A ninth vector meson coupled to the baryon current can be accomodated natarally in the scheme. It is predicted that the eight baryons should all have the same spin and parity and that pseudoscalar and vector mesons should form octets with possible additional singlets. The mathematics of the unitary group is described by considering three fictitious leptons, nu , e/sup -/ , and mu /sup -/, which may throw light on the structure of weak interactions. (D. L.C.)},

It is shown that in a U(3) scheme of triplets with integral charges, one is naturally led to three triplets located symmetrically about the origin of I3-Y diagram under the constraint that the Nishijima-Gell-Mann relation remains intact. A double SU(3) symmetry scheme is proposed in which the large mass splittings between different representations are ascribed to one of the SU(3), while the other SU(3) is the usual one for the mass splittings within a representation of the first SU(3).},

To construct models with complete naturalness for elementary particles one needs more types of confining gauge theories besides quantum chromodynamics. We propose a search program for models with improved naturalness and concentrate on the possibility that presently elementary fermions can be considered as composite. Chiral symmetry must then be responsible for the masslessness of these fermions. Thus we search for QCD-like models where chiral symmetry is not or only partly broken spontaneously. They are restricted by index relations that often cannot be satisfied by other than unphysical fractional indices. This difficulty made the author's own search unsuccessful so far. As a by-product we find yet another reason why in ordinary QCD chiral symmetry must be broken spontaneously.},

The improved event-mixing method was then applied for simulation as well as resonance analysis for experimental data from the ALICE experiment, and the results proved that this reweighing method can improve the performance on resonance signal extraction by reducing the residual background.},

Using DCCI2, we investigate effects of interplay between locally equilibrated and non-equilibrated systems, in other words, core and corona components in high-energy nuclear collisions. Given experimental multiplicity distributions and yield ratios of \$\textbackslash Omega\$ baryons to charged pions as inputs, we extract the fraction of core and corona components in p+p collisions at \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\}=7\$ TeV and Pb+Pb collisions at \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\_\{NN\}\}=2.76\$ TeV.

We also see that the core contribution exceeds the corona contribution only in 0.0-0.95\textbackslash\% multiplicity class in p+p collisions. Notably, there is a small enhancement of corona contribution with \$\textbackslash sim20\$\textbackslash\% below \$p\_T\textbackslash sim 1\$ GeV even in minimum bias Pb+Pb collisions. We find that the corona contribution at low \$p\_T\$ gives \$\textbackslash sim 15\$-\$38\$ \$\textbackslash\%\$ correction on \$v\_2\textbackslash\{2\textbackslash\}\$ at \$N\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ch\}\}\textbackslash lesssim 370\$. This raises a problem in conventional hydrodynamic analyses in which low \$p\_T\$ soft hadrons originate solely from core components. We finally scrutinize the roles of string fragmentation and the longitudinal expansion in the transverse energy per unit rapidity, which is crucial in initial conditions for hydrodynamics from event generators based on string models.},

Comparisons of our results with p anti-p data from CERN S p anti-p S and the Fermilab Tevatron, gamma p data from DESY HERA, and gamma gamma data from CERN LEP2 allow us to test the universality of the fragmentation functions predicted by the factorization theorem. Furthermore, we perform comparisons with (e\^+e\^-)-annihilation data from LEP2 so as to test the scaling violations predicted by the Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations.},

  abstract = {In recent investigations with the photographic method1,2, it has been shown that slow charged particles of small mass, present as a component of the cosmic radiation at high altitudes, can enter nuclei and produce disintegrations with the emission of heavy particles. It is convenient to apply the term `meson' to any particle with a mass intermediate between that of a proton and an electron. In continuing our experiments we have found evidence of mesons which, at the end of their range, produce secondary mesons. We have also observed transmutations in which slow mesons are ejected from disintegrating nuclei. Several features of these processes remain to be elucidated, but we present the following account of the experiments because the results appear to bear closely on the important problem of developing a satisfactory meson theory of nuclear forces.},

This article reviews the conditions under which CPT symmetry holds by recalling two proofs of the CPT theorem: The original Lagrangian-based analysis and the more rigorous one in the context of axiomatic quantum field theory. The presentation of the proofs is followed by a discussion of the major physical implications that arise from CPT symmetry. Motivated by recent theoretical and experimental interest in CPT tests, various approaches to the violation of CPT symmetry are mentioned, and it is briefly discussed how they evade the CPT theorem. An attempt has been made to keep this work self-contained and at a level suitable for a wider readership by excising as many technical aspects as possible.},

  abstract = {The U.S. Department of Energy's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) construction project was completed at BNL in 1999, with the first data-taking runs in the summer of 2000. Since then the early measurements at RHIC have yielded a wealth of data, from four independent detectors, each with its international collaboration of scientists: BRAHMS, PHENIX, PHOBOS, and STAR [1]. For the first time, collisions of heavy nuclei have been carried out at colliding-beam energies that have previously been accessible only for high-energy physics experiments with collisions of ''elementary'' particles such as protons and electrons. It is at these high energies that the predictions of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory that describes the role of quarks and gluons in nuclear matter, come into play, and new phenomena are sought that may illuminate our view of the basic structure of matter on the sub-atomic scale, with important implications for the origins of matter on the cosmic scale. The RHIC experiments have recorded data from collisions of gold nuclei at the highest energies ever achieved in man-made particle accelerators. These collisions, of which hundreds of millions have now been examined, result in final states of unprecedented complexity, with thousands of produced particles radiating from the nuclear collision. All four of the RHIC experiments have moved quickly to analyze these data, and have begun to understand the phenomena that unfold from the moment of collision as these particles are produced. In order to provide benchmarks of simpler interactions against which to compare the gold-gold collisions, the experiments have gathered comparable samples of data from collisions of a very light nucleus (deuterium) with gold nuclei, as well as proton-proton collisions, all with identical beam energies and experimental apparatus. The early measurements have revealed compelling evidence for the existence of a new form of nuclear matter at extremely high density and temperature--a medium in which the predictions of QCD can be tested, and new phenomena explored, under conditions where the relevant degrees of freedom, over nuclear volumes, are expected to be those of quarks and gluons, rather than of hadrons. This is the realm of the quark gluon plasma, the predicted state of matter whose existence and properties are now being explored by the RHIC experiments.},

  abstract = {Charmonium is a prominent probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), expected to be formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion (A-A) collisions. It has been predicted that the J/psi(c-cbar) particle is dissolved in the deconfined medium created in A-A systems. However this suppression can be counterbalanced via regeneration of the charm/anti-charm bound state in QGP or via statistical production at the phase boundary. At LHC energies, the latter mechanisms are expected to play a more important role, due to a charm production cross section significantly larger than at lower energies. Measurements obtained by the ALICE experiment for inclusive J/psi production are shown, making use of Pb-Pb data at sqrt(s\_NN) = 2.76 TeV, collected in 2010 and 2011. In particular, the focus is given on the nuclear modification factor, R\_AA, derived for forward (2.5 {$<$} y {$<$} 4) and mid rapidities (|y| {$<$} 0.9), both down to zero transverse momentum (pT). The centrality, y and pT dependences of R\_AA are presented and discussed in the context of theoretical models, together with PHENIX and CMS results.},

  abstract = {Strange quarks define a valuable probe for the understanding of quantum chromodynamics. The present PhD work falls within this scope; it deals with the study of multi-strange baryons {$\Xi$}\textendash ~(dss) and {$\Omega$}\textendash ~(sss) in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC. The analyses make use of the ALICE experiment and are performed at central rapidities (y~{$\approx~$}0) and low transverse momentum (pT~{$<~$}8,5~GeV/c). The production rates per event of these baryons are drawn from the measurement of differential spectra as a function of the hyperon momentum, d{$^2$}N~/~dpTdy~=~f(pT). At {$\surd$}s~=~0.9~TeV, the production for (~{$\Xi$}\textendash ~+~{$\Xi$}+~) in the inelastic pp interactions is derived from a small statistics of events. At {$\surd$}s~=~7~TeV, the large quantity of available data allows the measurement of production rates for each of the four species : {$\Xi$}\textendash, {$\Xi$}+, {$\Omega$}\textendash{} and {$\Omega$}+. At both energies, experimental data spectra are compared to spectra as produced by different benchmark phenomenological models (Pythia and Phojet). The comparison shows an unequivocal underestimate of the spectra by the Monte Carlo generators in their current versions (up to a factor \textasciitilde 4 for {$\Xi$}, \textasciitilde 15 for {$\Omega$}). Furthermore, an analysis of azimuthal correlations ({$\Xi\pm~$}-~h{$\pm$}) is led at intermediate pT (2~{$<~$}pT~{$<~$}5~GeV/c) for the pp data at {$\surd$}s~=~7~TeV. These correlations indicate that, when the momentum of {$\Xi\pm$} rises, the emission of the latter is preferentially done in correlation with jets},

  title = {Analysis Techniques for Femtoscopy and Correlation Studies in Small Collision Systems and Their Applications to the Investigation of p\textendash{{$\Lambda$}} and {{$\Lambda$}}\textendash{{$\Lambda$}} Interactions with {{ALICE}}},
  author = {Mihaylov, Dimitar Lubomirov},
  year = {2021},
  abstract = {Femtoscopy is a technique relating the correlations between pairs of particles to their emission source and interaction potential. Traditionally femtoscopy is used to study the properties of the emission source, mostly by using charged pion correlations, for which the correlation function is determined only by the Bose-Einstein statistics and Coulomb interaction. The topic of this work is the non-traditional baryon\textendash baryon femtoscopy, the goal of which is to study the interaction potential between different baryon pairs, assuming the emission source is fixed. Such an approach is quite challenging as it requires an exact treatment of the strong potential in order to compute the correlation function, as well as knowledge on the profile and size of the emission source. In the work presented here, a new ``Correlation Analysis Tool using the Schr\"odinger equation'' (CATS) has been developed to tackle the issue related to the modeling of the correla- tion function. In previous works it was proposed that in small collision systems the source is approximately the same for all baryon\textendash baryon pairs and this feature leads to the opportunity of using the p\textendash p correlations to fix the source, allowing to study the interaction of other pairs. However, the limits of validity of this method were never quantitatively studied. In particular, the decays of short-lived resonances are expected to influence the emission source differently based on the particle species involved. In this work a new model was developed to handle this effect, making possible to perform non-traditional femtoscopy with much higher precision. This new analysis techniques and method developed were used by the ALICE col- laboration to study a multitude of different baryon\textendash baryon systems, including p\textendash{$\Lambda$}, p\textendash{$\Sigma\sphat$}0 , p\textendash{$\Xi$} - , {$\Lambda$}\textendash{$\Lambda$}, p\textendash{$\Omega\sphat-$} and has even been applied to the meson sector to study the p\textendash K\^- interaction. Aside the development of CATS and the new source model, the author was the main analyzer of the p\textendash{$\Lambda$} and {$\Lambda$}\textendash{$\Lambda$} systems, therefore these results will be discussed in detail. In particular, the study of p\textendash{$\Lambda$} has an important link to the equation of state of nuclear matter and the existence of massive neutron stars. In this work the chiral effective field theory computations are verified against the p\textendash{$\Lambda$} data collected by the ALICE collaboration. The {$\Lambda$}\textendash{$\Lambda$} system is of great theo- retical interest, as some models predict the existence of a bound state, the so called H-dibaryon, which could be composed of two {$\Lambda$}s. The current work provides fur- ther experimental constraints on the {$\Lambda$}\textendash{$\Lambda$} scattering parameters and binding energy of the hypothetical bound state},

After a brief introduction to argue why finite density QCD can be a new attractive subject, we describe fundamental formulae which are necessary for the following sections. Then we survey lattice QCD simulations in small chemical potential regions, where several prominent works have been reported recently. Next, two-color QCD calculations are discussed, where we have a chance to glance at many new features of finite density QCD, and indeed recent simulations indicated quark pair condensation and the in-medium effect. Tables of SU(3) and SU(2) lattice simulations at finite baryon density are given. In the next section, we make a survey of several related works which may be a starting point of the new development in the future, although some works do not attract much attention now. Materials are described in a pedagogical manner. Starting from a simple 2-d model, we briefly discuss a lattice analysis of NJL model. We describe a non-perturbative analytical approach, i.e., strong coupling approximation method and some results. Canonical ensemble approach instead of usual grand canonical ensample may be another route to reach high density. We examine the density of state method and show this old idea includes recently proposed factorization method. An alternative method, complex Langevin equation and an interesting model, finite isospin model, are also discussed. In Appendix, we give several technical points which are useful in practical calculations.},

At a special seminar on 10 February, spokespersons from the experiments on CERN1's Heavy Ion programme presented compelling evidence for the existence of a new state of matter in which quarks, instead of being bound up into more complex particles such as protons and neutrons, are liberated to roam freely. Geneva, 10 February 2000. At a special seminar on 10 February, spokespersons from the experiments on CERN1's Heavy Ion programme presented compelling evidence for the existence of a new state of matter in which quarks, instead of being bound up into more complex particles such as protons and neutrons, are liberated to roam freely. Theory predicts that this state must have existed at about 10 microseconds after the Big Bang, before the formation of matter as we know it today, but until now it had not been confirmed experimentally. Our understanding of how the universe was created, which was previously unverified theory for any point in time before the formation of ordinary atomic nuclei, about three minutes after the Big Bang, has with these results now been experimentally tested back to a point only a few microseconds after the Big Bang. Professor Luciano Maiani, CERN Director General, said "The combined data coming from the seven experiments on CERN's Heavy Ion programme have given a clear picture of a new state of matter. This result verifies an important prediction of the present theory of fundamental forces between quarks. It is also an important step forward in the understanding of the early evolution of the universe. We now have evidence of a new state of matter where quarks and gluons are not confined. There is still an entirely new territory to be explored concerning the physical properties of quark-gluon matter. The challenge now passes to the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and later to CERN's Large Hadron Collider." The aim of CERN's Heavy Ion programme was to collide lead ions so as to create immensely high energy densities which would break down the forces which confined quarks inside more complex particles. A very high energy beam of lead ions (33 TeV) was accelerated in CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and crashed into targets inside the seven different experimental detectors. The collisions created temperatures over 100 000 times as hot as the centre of the sun, and energy densities twenty times that of ordinary nuclear matter, densities which have never before been reached in laboratory experiments. The collected data from the experiments gives compelling evidence that a new state of matter has been created. This state of matter found in heavy ion collisions at the SPS features many of the characteristics of the theoretically predicted quark-gluon plasma, the primordial soup in which quarks and gluons existed before they clumped together as the universe cooled down. The lead beam programme started in 1994, after the CERN accelerators has been upgraded by a collaboration between CERN and institutes in the Czech Republic, France, India, Italy, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. A new lead ion source was linked to pre-existing, interconnected accelerators, at CERN, the Proton Synchrotron (PS) and the SPS. The seven large experiments involved measured different aspects of lead-lead and lead-gold collisions. They were named NA44, NA45, NA49, NA50, NA52, WA97 / NA57 and WA98. Some of these experiments use multipurpose detectors to measure and correlate several of the more abundant observable phenomena. Others are dedicated experiments to detect rare signatures with high statistics. This co-ordinated effort using several complementing experiments has proven very successful. The project is an excellent example of collaboration in physics research. Scientists from institutes in over twenty countries** have participated in the experiments. The programme has also allowed a productive partnership to develop between high energy physicists and nuclear physicists. More importantly, this step forward has been made possible by the collaboration between the individual experiments. The picture of quark-gluon plasma resembles a jigsaw puzzle, with many pieces provided by the different experiments. The data from any one experiment is not enough to give the full picture but the combined results from all experiments agree and fit. Whereas all attempts to explain them using established particle interactions have failed, many of the observations are consistent with the predicted signatures of a quark-gluon plasma. The results from CERN present strong incentive for the future planned experiments. While all of the pieces of the puzzle seem to fit with a quark-gluon plasma explanation, it is essential to study this newly produced matter at higher and lower temperature in order to fully characterize its properties and definitively confirm the quark gluon plasma interpretation. The focus of heavy ion research now moves to the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United States, which will start experiments this year. In 2005 CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experimental programme will include a dedicated heavy ion experiment, ALICE. !!

  abstract = {Charmed baryon polarization is not predicted by theory and it is a necessary input for the measurement of the charmed baryons magnetic dipole moment (MDM) which is foreseen at the LHC. Baryon's polarization has been measured for strange (Lambda) and beauty (Lambda\_b) baryons in different colliding systems, however, no measurement exists for charmed baryons as of today. In this thesis, the Lambda\_c polarization is measured by mean of a five-dimensional amplitude analysis of the three-body weak decay Lc-{$>$}pKpi of Lc produced in pp collisions at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV.The Lc-{$>$}pKpi decay passes through intermediate resonant states which interfere with each other, and which need to be included in the amplitude. First, the equations describing the amplitude of this three-body decay have been derived within the helicity formalism. The polarization is accounted for by mean of the spin density matrix and the intermediate resonant states are described using the isobar model factorization. This work allowed to better understand the helicity amplitudes and can be easily extended to other three-body baryonic decays featuring particles with spin in the final state.Then, the helicity amplitudes obtained are used to describe the data collected by the LHCb detector at CERN during the 2016 data taking period (Run 2), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.7 fb\^-1. Since the polarization depends on the production mechanism involved, it is important to separate the Lc produced directly after the pp collisions via strong interactions (prompt production), from the Lc produced via a weak decay of other baryons (secondary production). In this analysis, the promptly produced Lc are studied.The Lc-{$>$}pKpi decay, with a branching ratio of 6.28 +- 0.32 \%, is the most abundant Lc decay mode and the final data sample, after the optimization of the selection chain, contains around \textasciitilde 500 000 signal events, it has a signal purity of \textasciitilde 97\% and the contamination due to secondary Lc is less than 2 \%. The asymmetry parameters of the intermediate decays, which are combinations of the helicity couplings contained in the amplitude, are also measured along with the fit fractions, which describe the contribution of each resonance to the total amplitude. The results of the Lc-{$>$}pKpi amplitude analysis will be used to measure the polarization of Lc baryons produced in proton gas (pNe) collisions, using a data sample collected by the LHCb detector during 2017 at a center of mass energy of 68 GeV.The next data acquisition phase, foreseen in 2022, will see an increase of the collision rate by a factor of 5 at LHCb. A new detector, called PLUME, has been designed to perform a luminosity measurement in the new running conditions. In this thesis, the front-end electronics of the LHCb calorimeter has been tested to prove that it is adapted for the PLUME detector needs and it is now the baseline electronics for PLUME. Finally, a measurement of the LHCb clock shift using the PLUME detector is proposed. The LHCb clock can be desynchronized from the LHC main clock; a shift up to 1 ns has been measured during Run 1 and Run 2, using the Outer Tracker (OT), with a time resolution of 0.5 ns. During Run 3 the OT will be removed and LHCb will collect data at 40 MHz with a new triggering scheme based on an entirely software trigger. Stable running conditions are essential for such a scheme to work, and the clock shift could have a large impact on the LHCb detector performances. PLUME could be used to monitor the LHCb clock shift and in this thesis a preliminary timing measurement is performed probing the feasibility of such a measurement and opening the route to further studies.},

This discussion is also used to give a qualitative proof of the CPT Theorem, and some of the stringent tests of this theorem in the neutral Kaon sector are reviewed. In the second part of these lectures, global symmetries are examined. Here, after the distinction between Wigner-Weyl and Nambu-Goldstone realizations of these symmetries is explained, a discussion is given of the various, approximate or real, global symmetries of the Standard Model. Particular attention is paid to the role that chiral anomalies play in altering the classical symmetry patterns of the Standard Model. To understand the differences between anomaly effects in QCD and those in the electroweak theory, a discussion of the nature of the vacuum structure of gauge theories is presented. This naturally raises the issue of the strong CP problem, and I present a brief discussion of the chiral solution to this problem and of its ramifications for astrophysics and cosmology. I also touch briefly on possible constraints on, and prospects for, having real Nambu-Goldstone bosons in nature, concentrating specifically on the simplest example of Majorons. I end these lectures by discussing the compatibility of having global symmetry in the presence of gravitational interactions. Although these interactions, in general, produces small corrections, they can alter significantly the Nambu-Goldstone sector of theories.},

  abstract = {An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory is a textbook intended for the graduate physics course covering relativistic quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, and Feynman diagrams. The authors make these subjects accessible through carefully worked examples illustrating the technical aspects of the subject, and intuitive explanations of what is going on behind the mathematics. After presenting the basics of quantum electrodynamics, the authors discuss the theory of renormalization and its relation to statistical mechanics, and introduce the renormalization group. This discussion sets the stage for a discussion of the physical principles that underlie the fundamental interactions of elementary particle physics and their description by gauge field theories.},

It is the main ingredient to describe the dynamics of experimental heavy ion collisions, the expansion of the early universe in the standard model era and the interior of compact stars. On most scales of interest, QCD is strongly coupled and not amenable to perturbative investigations. Over the last decade, first principles calculations using lattice QCD have reached maturity, in the sense that for particular discretisation schemes simulations at the physical point have become possible, finite temperature results near the continuum limit are available and systematic errors begin to be controlled.

Since the last public release in 2009, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments have provided a number of very interesting data sets comprising minimum bias p-p,p-Pb, and Pb-Pb interactions. We describe the changes required to the model to reproduce in detail the new data available from the LHC and the consequences in the interpretation of these data. In particular we discuss the effect of the collective hadronization in p-p scattering. A different parametrization of flow has been introduced in the case of a small volume with high density of thermalized matter (core) reached in p-p compared to large volume produced in heavy ion collisions. Both parametrizations depend only on the geometry and the amount of secondary particles entering in the core and not on the beam mass or energy. The transition between the two flow regimes can be tested with p-Pb data. Epos LHC is able to reproduce all minimum bias results for all particles with transverse momentum from pt=0 to a few GeV/c.},

  abstract = {A l'instar des trois autres exp\'eriences aupr\`es du collisionneur RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) du Brookhaven National Laboratory pr\`es de New York, STAR (Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC) est enti\`erement consacr\'ee \`a la mise en \'evidence de cet \'etat particulier de la mati\`ere nucl\'eaire pr\'edit par les calculs de QCD (Quantum ChromoDynamics) sur r\'eseau : le plasma de quarks et de gluons (QGP pour Quark Gluon Plasma). Cet \'etat, suppos\'e \^etre celui de l'Univers quelques fractions de secondes apr\`es le Big Bang, consisterait d'apr\`es sa d\'efinition originelle de 1975, en une mati\`ere dans laquelle quarks et gluons seraient d\'econfin\'es, sans interaction. Il pourrait \^etre cr\'e\'e en laboratoire lors de collisions d'ions lourds r\'ealis\'ees \`a des \'energies ultra-relativistes afin d'atteindre des temp\'eratures et densit\'es d'\'energie extr\^emes.{$<$}br /{$>$}Apr\`es quasiment 20 ans de recherche aupr\`es des diff\'erents acc\'el\'erateurs de particules am\'ericains et europ\'eens, le CERN annonce le 10 f\'evrier 2000 au cours d'une conf\'erence de presse, la mise en \'evidence exp\'erimentale d'un \'etat particulier de la mati\`ere nucl\'eaire, compatible avec la formation d'un QGP, sans pouvoir toutefois le caract\'eriser pleinement. Les exp\'eriences du RHIC ont alors pris le relais. Aujourd'hui, au travers une pl\'ethore de r\'esultats nouveaux et parfois bien surprenants, il appara\^it de fa\c{c}on de plus en plus certaine, qu'effectivement un \'etat atypique de mati\`ere nucl\'eaire a \'et\'e cr\'e\'e \`a RHIC et notre vision du QGP comme un gaz parfait de partons n'interagissant que tr\`es faiblement, a depuis chang\'e. Un nouvel acronyme a \'et\'e d\'efini : sQGP pour Strongly Interacting QGP. {$<$}br /{$>$}Pour parvenir \`a cette observation, il a fallu passer par la caract\'erisation m\^eme de l'\'evolution des collisions d'ions lourds, du point de vue chimique et dynamique, en comparant les ph\'enom\`enes des collisions d'ions lourds pour lesquelles les conditions devraient \^etre r\'eunies pour former un QGP \`a des collisions d'\'energies moindres ou de syst\`emes plus l\'egers qui ne peuvent permettre cette formation. Le QGP est en effet produit de mani\`ere beaucoup trop furtive pour pouvoir le sonder directement. Mon m\'emoire d'Habilitation \`a Diriger des Recherches pr\'esente les r\'esultats des analyses que j'ai men\'ees et qui ont contribu\'e \`a la mise en \'evidence de la formation d'un \'etat nouveau au RHIC et \`a cette nouvelle vision du plasma. Les stigmates du QGP ont \'et\'e recherch\'es avec les particules contenant des quarks \'etranges : les r\'esonances de particules simplement \'etranges et les baryons doublement \'etranges. {$<$}br /{$>$}La production des r\'esonances \'etranges Lambda(1520) apporte en effet des informations sur la phase d'hadronisation du plasma (lorsque les partons se recomposent en hadrons) : selon leur observation ou non, il pourrait \^etre possible de caract\'eriser le freeze-out chimique (instant o\`u les interactions in\'elastiques cessent et la composition chimique du syst\`eme est fig\'ee), le freeze-out cin\'etique (instant o\`u les interactions \'elastiques cessent et les particules n'interagissent plus), si ces deux freeze-out co\"incident ou si, au contraire ils sont s\'epar\'es dans le temps et de combien. L'id\'ee est la suivante : les Lambdas(1520) se d\'esint\`egrent quasiment instantan\'ement en un proton et un kaon. Par cons\'equent, si le temps entre les freeze-out chimique et cin\'etique est long, les produits de d\'esint\'egration de ces particules peuvent \^etre absorb\'es dans le milieu dense qui a \'et\'e cr\'e\'e. En revanche, si les deux freeze-out co\"incident ou sont tr\`es proches, les produits de d\'esint\'egration ne sont pas affect\'es et la particule m\`ere, c'est-\`a-dire la r\'esonance, peut \^etre identifi\'ee. Ainsi, en mesurant les taux de production de ces particules dans les collisions proton\textendash proton pour lesquelles les deux freeze-out co\"incident, et en comparant les taux obtenus dans les collisions Au\textendash Au, \`a l'\'energie nominale du RHIC, il est apparu qu'effectivement, au moins 4 fm/c s\'eparent les deux freeze-out dans les collisions Au\textendash Au. Cette conclusion constitue une \'etape importante dans la compr\'ehension des collisions d'ions lourds ultra-relativistes et du comportement de la mati\`ere dans des conditions extr\^emes. Cette analyse est apparue comme originale au sein de la collaboration STAR, \'etant la premi\`ere \'etude sur les r\'esonances \'etranges. Des algorithmes sp\'ecifiques ont d\^u \^etre mis au point et sont largement utilis\'es au sein de la collaboration qui depuis \'etudie de nombreuses autres r\'esonances ou recherche des objets plus exotiques. {$<$}br /{$>$}La production des baryons \'etranges a \'et\'e largement investigu\'ee les ann\'ees pass\'ees car une augmentation \guillemotleft{} anormale \guillemotright{} des taux de production est attendue si un QGP est form\'e. Les exp\'eriences du CERN ont observ\'e effectivement une surproduction de l'\'etranget\'e dans les collisions Pb\textendash Pb mais n'ont pu conclure de mani\`ere d\'ecisive quant \`a une formation \'eventuelle d'un plasma car ces r\'esultats pouvaient \^etre \'egalement reproduits par des mod\`eles de gaz de hadrons. Nous avons men\'e une analyse similaire avec les donn\'ees de STAR en comparant les taux de production des Xi, baryons doublement \'etranges, dans les collisions proton\textendash proton et Au\textendash Au \`a sqrt(s\_NN) = 200 GeV. L\`a aussi, les r\'esultats sont demeur\'es ambigus. Ainsi, ces r\'esultats ont conduit un certain nombre de physiciens \`a ne plus consid\'erer les taux de production de particules \'etranges comme une signature robuste de la formation d'un QGP. En revanche, l'\'etranget\'e est revenue sur le devant de la sc\`ene, de fa\c{c}on plus indirecte donnant des informations tr\`es diverses et sur les diff\'erentes \'etapes de la collision. {$<$}br /{$>$}Les Xi ont r\'ev\'el\'e tout d'abord que le syst\`eme cr\'e\'e \`a l'\'energie nominale du RHIC serait en \'equilibre thermique et chimique et que les temp\'eratures de freeze-out chimique sont proches de la temp\'erature de d\'econfinement pr\'edite par QCD. Nous avons \'egalement \'etudi\'e les ph\'enom\`enes dynamiques collectifs, appel\'es flot, qui naissent des interactions entre constituants et se traduisent par une \'emission de mati\`ere dans des directions privil\'egi\'ees de l'espace de phase. En accord avec leurs faibles sections efficaces d'interaction, les Xi semblent \'emis bien plus t\^ot que les particules plus l\'eg\`eres. Toutefois, le fait que ces baryons subissent un flot important, laisse supposer qu'elles auraient d\'evelopp\'e un flot, donc qu'elles auraient \'et\'e soumises \`a des interactions, avant la phase d'hadronisation, autrement dit, dans une phase partonique. Les partons subiraient donc des interactions r\'esiduelles, contrairement \`a ce que pr\'econisaient les th\'eoriciens du milieu des ann\'ees soixante-dix.{$<$}br /{$>$}Par ailleurs, en 2003, les quatre exp\'eriences du RHIC ont r\'ev\'el\'e conjointement la mise en \'evidence du ph\'enom\`ene de jet-quenching dans les collisions d'ions lourds : il traduit une diminution de la production de particules charg\'ees de tr\`es haute impulsion transverse s'expliquant par la perte d'\'energie des partons dans un milieu tr\`es dense. Nous avons r\'ealis\'e cette analyse en consid\'erant les X et montr\'e que non seulement ces baryons subissent un jet-quenching mais aussi qu'ils ont un comportement diff\'erent de celui des m\'esons. Une d\'ependance des ph\'enom\`enes dynamiques au type de particules a ainsi \'et\'e mise en \'evidence en accord avec les mod\`eles de coalescence pr\'econisant que les hadrons se forment \`a partir de la recombinaison des quarks. L\`a aussi, \'emergence des partons comme degr\'es de libert\'e pertinents. {$<$}br /{$>$}A partir de ces r\'esultats entre autres, certains th\'eoriciens affirment la d\'ecouverte du QGP \`a RHIC mais les exp\'erimentateurs sont plus prudents et d\'esirent auparavant confirmer et enrichir leurs r\'esultats par l'\'etude d'autres observables qui viendraient corroborer ces observations. Ces ann\'ees ont \'et\'e particuli\`erement stimulantes par l'\'evolution de nos connaissances gr\^ace aux formidables r\'esultats produits par les quatre exp\'eriences du RHIC. Les \guillemotleft{} vielles \guillemotright{} signatures ont fait peau neuve se transformant en sondes nouvelles et riches en informations originales. La conception du QGP a \'evolu\'e : il ne s'agit plus d'un gaz parfait constitu\'e de partons \'evoluant librement mais d'un sQGP.},

  abstract = {The notion that fundamental equations governing the motions of physical systems are invariant under the time reversal transformation (T) has been an important, but often subliminal, element in the development of theoretical physics. It serves as a powerful and useful tool in analyzing the structure of matter at all scales, from gases and condensed matter to subnuclear physics and the quantum theory of fields. The assumption of invariance under T was called into question, however, by the 1964 discovery that a closely related assumption, that of CP invariance (where C is charge conjugation and P is space inversion), is violated in the decay of neutral K mesons. In The Physics of Time Reversal, Robert G. Sachs comprehensively treats the role of the transformation T, both as a tool for analyzing the structure of matter and as a field of fundamental research relating to CP violation. For this purpose he reformulates the definitions of T, P, and C so as to avoid subliminal assumptions of invariance. He summarizes the standard phenomenology of CP violation in the K-meson system and addresses the question of the mysterious origin of CP violation. Using simple examples based on the standard quark model, Sachs summarizes and illustrates how these phenomenological methods can be extended to analysis of future experiments on heavy mesons. He notes that his reformulated approach to conventional quantum field theory leads to new questions about the meaning of the transformations in the context of recent theoretical developments such as non-Abelian gauge theories, and he suggests ways in which these questions may lead to new directions of research.},

  abstract = {All the symmetry models of strong interactions which have been proposed up to the present are devoid of deep physical foundations. It is suggested that, instead of postulating artificial ``higher'' symmetries which must be broken anyway within the realm of strong interactions, we take the existing exact symmetries of strong interactions more seriously than before and exploit them to the utmost limit. A new theory of strong interactions is proposed on this basis. Following Yang and Mills we require that the gauge transformations that are associated with the three ``internal'' conservation laws\textemdash baryon conservation, hypercharge conservation, and isospin conservation\textemdash be ``consistent with the local field concept that underlies the usual physical theories.'' In analogy with electromagnetism there emerge three kinds of couplings such that in each case a massive vector field is coupled linearly to the conserved current in question. Each of the three fundamental couplings is characterized by a single universal constant. Since, as Pais has shown, there are no other internal symmetries that are exact, and since any successful theory must be simple, there are no other fundamental strong couplings. Parity conservation in strong interactions follows as the direct consequence of parity conservation of the three fundamental vector couplings. The three vector couplings give rise to corresponding current-current interactions. Yukawa-type couplings of pions and K particles to baryons are ``phenomenological,'' and may arise, for instance, out of four-baryon current-current interactions along the lines suggested by Fermi and Yang. All the successful features of Chew-Low type meson theories and of relativistic dispersion relations can, in principle, be in accordance with the theory whereas none of the predictions based on relativistic Yukawa-type Lagrangians are meaningful unless {$\omega$}M is considerably less than unity. Simple and direct experimental tests of the theory should be looked for in those phenomena in which phenomenological Yukawa-type couplings are likely to play unimportant roles. The fundamental isospin current coupling in the static limit gives rise to a short-range repulsion (attraction) between two particles whenever the isospins are parallel (antiparallel). Thus the low-energy s-wave {$\pi$}N interaction should be repulsive in the T = 32 state and attractive in the T = 12 state in agreement with observation. In {$\pi\Sigma$} s-wave scattering the T = 0 state is strongly attractive, and there definitely exists the possibility of an s-wave resonance at energies of the order of the K-p threshold, while the T = 1 {$\pi\Sigma$} phase shift is likely to remain small; using the K matrix formalism of Dalitz and Tuan, we might be able to compare the ``ideal'' phase shifts derived in this manner with the ``actual'' phase shifts deduced from K-p reactions. It is expected that the two-pion system exhibits a resonant behavior in the T = 1 (p-wave) state in agreement with the conjecture of Frazer and Fulco based on the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon. The three pion system is expected to exhibit two T = 0, J = 1 resonances. It is conjectured that the two T = 12 and one T = 32 ``higher rsonances'' in the {$\pi$}N interactions may be due to the two T = 0 3{$\pi$} resonances and the one T = 1 2{$\pi$} resonance predicted by the theory. Multiple pion production is expected at all energies to be more frequent than that predicted on the basis of statistical considerations. The fundamental hypercharge current coupling gives rise to a short-range repulsion (attraction) between two charge-doublet particles when their hypercharges are like (opposite). If the isospin current coupling is effectively weaker than the hypercharge current coupling, the KN ``potential'' should be repulsive and the KN ``potential'' should be attractive, and the charge exchange scattering of K+ and K- should be relatively rare, at least in s states. All these features seem to be in agreement with current experiments. Conditions for the validity of Pais' doublet approximation are discussed. The theory offers a possible explanation for the long-standing problem as to why associated production cross sections are small and K- cross sections are large. The empirical fact that the ratio of (KK2N) to (K{$\Lambda$}N) + (K{$\Sigma$}N) in NN collisions seems to be about twenty to thirty times larger than simple statistical considerations indicate is not surprising. The fundamental baryonic current coupling gives rise to a short-range repulsion for baryon-baryon interactions and an attraction for baryon-antibaryon interactions. There should be effects similar to those expected from ``repulsive cores'' for all angular momentum and parity states in both the T = 1 and T = 0, NN interactions at short distances though the T = 1 state may be more repulsive. A simple Thomas-type calculation gives rise to a spin-orbit force of the right sign with not unreasonable order of magnitude. The {$\Lambda$}N and {$\Sigma$}N interactions at short distances should be somewhat less repulsive than the NN interactions. Annihilation cross sections in NN collisions are expected to be large even in Bev regions in contrast to the predictions of Ball and Chew. The observed large pion multiplicity in NN annihilations is not mysterious. It is possible to invent a reasonable mechanism which makes the reaction p + p \textrightarrow{} {$\pi$}+ + {$\pi-$} very rare, as recently observed. Fermi-Landau-Heisenberg type theories of high energy collisions are not expected to hold in relativistic NN collisions; instead the theory offers a theoretical justification for the ``two-fire-ball model`` of high-energy jets previously proposed on purely phenomenological grounds. Because of the strong short-range attraction between a baryon and antibaryon there exists a mechanism for a baryon-antibaryon pair to form a meson. The dynamical basis of the Fermi-Yang-Sakata-Okun model as well as that of the Goldhaber-Christy model follows naturally from the theory; all the ad hoc assumptions that must be made in order that the compound models work at all can be explained from first principles. It is suggested that one should not ask which elementary particles are ``more elementary than others,'' and which compound model is right, but rather characterize each particle only by its internal properties such as total hypercharge and mean-square baryonic radius. Although the fundamental couplings of the theory are highly symmetric and universal, it is possible for the three couplings alone to account for the observed mass spectrum. The theory can explain, in a trivial manner, why there are no ``elementary'' particles with baryon number greater than unity provided that the baryonic current coupling is sufficiently strong. The question of whether or not an |S| = 2 meson exists is a dynamical one (not a group-theoretic one) that depends on the strength of the hypercharge current coupling. A possible reason for the nonexistence of a {$\pi$}0{${'}$} (charge-singlet, nonstrange boson) is given. The theory realizes Pais' principles of economy of constants and of a hierarchy of interactions in a natural and elegant manner. It is conjectured that there exists a deep connection between the law of conservation of fermions and the universal V-A weak coupling. In the absence of strong and electromagnetic interactions, baryonic charge, hypercharge, and electric charge all disappear, and only the sign of {$\gamma$}5 can distinguish a fermion from an antifermion, the fermionic charge being diagonalized by {$\gamma$}5; hence 1 + {$\gamma$}5 appears naturally in weak interactions. Parity conservation in strong interactions, parity conservation in electromagnetic interactions, parity nonconservation in weak interactions can all be understood from the single common principle of generalized gauge invariance. It appears that in the future ultimate theory of elementary particles all elementary particle interactions will be manifestations of the five fundamental vector-type couplings corresponding to the five conservation laws of ``internal attributes''\textemdash baryonic charge, hypercharge, isospin, electric charge, and fermionic charge. Gravity and cosmology are briefly discussed; it is estimated that the Compton wavelength of the graviton is of the order of 108 light years. It is suggested that every conceivable experimental attempt be made to detect directly quantum manifestations of the vector fields introduced in the theory, especially by studying Q values of pions in various combinations in NN annihilations and in multiple pion production.},

  abstract = {A strongly interacting state of matter known as the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is formed in the high temperature and high energy density conditions reached in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, such as the Pb\textendash Pb collisions measured at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). One of the key measurements for the understanding of the properties of the QGP medium created in these collisions is the production of strange and multi-strange hadrons. ALICE is one of the four major experiments of the LHC and has a detector designed to study identified particle production rates from heavy-ion collisions. The excellent tracking and particle identification capabilities allow the reconstruction of multi-strange baryons (\$\textbackslash Xi\^\{-\}\$, \$\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash Xi\}\^\{+\}\$,  \$\textbackslash Omega\^\{-\}\$ and \$\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash Omega\}\^\{+\}\$) via their weak decay channels over a large range in transverse momentum (\$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$).  In this thesis, we study the multi-strange particle production at central rapidity Pb\textendash Pb collisions measured by ALICE at the unprecedented energy of \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\_\{NN\}\} = 5.02\$ TeV and \$2.76\$ TeV. The yields are normalized by the corresponding measurement of pion production in the same centrality class in order to study the strangeness enhancement, effect predicted as a probe of the QGP. Comparison of hyperon-to-pion ratio between different systems, such as pp, p\textendash pb and Pb\textendash Pb collisions, shows that production of multi-strange baryons relative to pions follows a continuously increasing trend from low multiplicity pp to central Pb\textendash Pb collisions.},

The physics is then not understood well enough to give an exact description; instead the program has to be based on a combination of analytical results and various QCD-based models. This physics input is summarized here, for areas such as hard subprocesses, initial- and final-state parton showers, underlying events and beam remnants, fragmentation and decays, and much more. Furthermore, extensive information is provided on all program elements: subroutines and functions, switches and parameters, and particle and process data.

The theory-experiment comparison suggests that central Au+Au collisions at RHIC produce dense, rapidly thermalizing matter characterized by: (1) initial energy densities above the critical values predicted by lattice QCD for establishment of a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP); (2) nearly ideal fluid flow, marked by constituent interactions of very short mean free path, established most probably at a stage preceding hadron formation; and (3) opacity to jets. Many of the observations are consistent with models incorporating QGP formation in the early collision stages, and have not found ready explanation in a hadronic framework. However, the measurements themselves do not yet establish unequivocal evidence for a transition to this new form of matter. The theoretical treatment of the collision evolution, despite impressive successes, invokes a suite of distinct models, degrees of freedom and assumptions of as yet unknown quantitative consequence. We pose a set of important open questions, and suggest additional measurements, at least some of which should be addressed in order to establish a compelling basis to conclude definitively that thermalized, deconfined quark-gluon matter has been produced at RHIC.},

This feat was made possible thanks to the operators who had worked around the clock since the restart of the LHC in April to ensure the smooth beginning of these collisions with higher-intensity beams and increased energy. After over three years of upgrade and maintenance work, the LHC is now set to run for close to four years at the record energy of 13.6 trillion electronvolts (TeV), providing greater precision and discovery potential. Increased collision rates, higher collision energy, upgraded data readout and selection systems, new detector systems and computing infrastructure: all these factors point to a promising physics season that will further expand the already very diverse LHC physics programme!

  abstract = {This is a brief summary of topics that were presented as lectures within the programme "New Frontiers in QCD 2010" at the Yukawa Institute of Theoretical Physics in Kyoto. The basic subject is phases and symmetry breaking patterns as they emerge from the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD. Part I focuses on the QCD interface with nuclear physics via chiral effective field theory. This includes nuclear thermodynamics and, in particular, constraints for compressed and hot baryonic matter provided by the density and temperature dependence of the chiral condensate. Part II explores aspects of the QCD phase diagram using a non-local improved version of the Polyakov - Nambu - Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. A prominent feature of such an approach is the occurence of a dynamical entanglement between chiral and deconfinement crossover transitions. Comparisons with available results from lattice QCD thermodynamics will be made.},

  abstract = {The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) is a global computing infrastructure whose mission is to provide computing resources to store, distribute and analyse the data generated by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), making the data equally available to all partners, regardless of their physical location. WLCG is the world's largest computing grid. It is supported by many associated national and international grids across the world, such as European Grid Initiative (Europe-based) and Open Science Grid (US-based), as well as many other regional grids. WLCG is co-ordinated by CERN. It is managed and operated by a worldwide collaboration between the experiments (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb) and the participating computer centres. It is reviewed by a board of delegates from partner country funding agencies, and scientifically reviewed by the LHC Experiments Committee.},
