	abstract = {ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16 × 16 × 26 m3 with a total weight of approximately 10 000 t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems each with its own specific technology choice and design constraints, driven both by the physics requirements and the experimental conditions expected at LHC. The most stringent design constraint is to cope with the extreme particle multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad range in momentum, up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC. This will allow for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons, and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei. Most detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for data taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start operation, with the exception of parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010. This paper describes in detail the detector components as installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008.},

	abstract = {A strongly interacting state of matter known as the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is formed in the high temperature and high energy density conditions reached in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, such as the Pb–Pb collisions measured at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). One of the key measurements for the understanding of the properties of the QGP medium created in these collisions is the production of strange and multi-strange hadrons. ALICE is one of the four major experiments of the LHC and has a detector designed to study identified particle production rates from heavy-ion collisions. The excellent tracking and particle identification capabilities allow the reconstruction of multi-strange baryons (\${\textbackslash}Xi{\textasciicircum}\{-\}\$, \${\textbackslash}bar\{{\textbackslash}Xi\}{\textasciicircum}\{+\}\$,  \${\textbackslash}Omega{\textasciicircum}\{-\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}bar\{{\textbackslash}Omega\}{\textasciicircum}\{+\}\$) via their weak decay channels over a large range in transverse momentum (\$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$).  In this thesis, we study the multi-strange particle production at central rapidity Pb–Pb collisions measured by ALICE at the unprecedented energy of \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\_\{NN\}\} = 5.02\$ TeV and \$2.76\$ TeV. The yields are normalized by the corresponding measurement of pion production in the same centrality class in order to study the strangeness enhancement, effect predicted as a probe of the QGP. Comparison of hyperon-to-pion ratio between different systems, such as pp, p–pb and Pb–Pb collisions, shows that production of multi-strange baryons relative to pions follows a continuously increasing trend from low multiplicity pp to central Pb–Pb collisions.},

The observed distributions of transverse momentum, rapidity, and multiplicity are corrected to hadron level in a model-independent way within well defined phase-space regions. The distribution of the production ratio of Lambdabar to Lambda baryons is also measured. The results are compared with various Monte Carlo simulation models. Although most of these models agree with data to within 15\% in the Kshort distributions, substantial disagreements with data are found in the Lambda distributions of transverse momentum.},

In order to avoid auto-correlation biases, the actual transverse momentum (\$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{T\}\}\$) spectra of the particles under study and the event activity are measured in different rapidity windows. In the highest multiplicity class, the charged-particle density reaches about 3.5 times the value measured in inelastic collisions. While the yield of protons normalized to pions remains approximately constant as a function of multiplicity, the corresponding ratios of strange hadrons to pions show a significant enhancement that increases with increasing strangeness content. Furthermore, all identified particle to pion ratios are shown to depend solely on charged-particle multiplicity density, regardless of system type and collision energy. The evolution of the spectral shapes with multiplicity and hadron mass shows patterns that are similar to those observed in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies. The obtained \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{T\}\}\$ distributions and yields are compared to expectations from QCD-based pp event generators as well as to predictions from thermal and hydrodynamic models. These comparisons indicate that traces of a collective, equilibrated system are already present in high-multiplicity pp collisions.},

	abstract = {We report on the first femtoscopic measurement of baryon pairs, such as p−p, p−Λ, and Λ−Λ, measured by ALICE at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in proton-proton collisions at √s=7TeV. This study demonstrates the feasibility of such measurements in pp collisions at ultrarelativistic energies. The femtoscopy method is employed to constrain the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions, which are still rather poorly understood. A new method to evaluate the influence of residual correlations induced by the decays of resonances and experimental impurities is hereby presented. The p−p, p−Λ, and Λ−Λ correlation functions were fitted simultaneously with the help of a new tool developed specifically for the femtoscopy analysis in small colliding systems: Correlation Analysis Tool using the Schrödinger equation (CATS). Within the assumption that in pp collisions the three particle pairs originate from a common source, its radius is found to be equal to r0=1.125±0.018(stat)+0.058−0.035(syst) fm. The sensitivity of the measured p−Λ correlation is tested against different scattering parameters, which are defined by the interaction among the two particles, but the statistics is not sufficient yet to discriminate among different models. The measurement of the Λ−Λ correlation function constrains the phase space spanned by the effective range and scattering length of the strong interaction. Discrepancies between the measured scattering parameters and the resulting correlation functions at LHC and RHIC energies are discussed in the context of various models.},

This assumption was checked by Monte-Carlo simulations with PYTHIA, and a certain method of correction called reweighing was proposed to improve the event-mixing method. The improved event-mixing method was then applied for simulation as well as resonance analysis for experimental data from the ALICE experiment, and the results proved that this reweighing method can improve the performance on resonance signal extraction by reducing the residual background.},

The objective is to provide as accurate as possible a representation of event properties in a wide range of reactions, within and beyond the Standard Model, with emphasis on those where strong interactions play a role, directly or indirectly, and therefore multihadronic final states are produced. The physics is then not understood well enough to give an exact description; instead the program has to be based on a combination of analytical results and various QCD-based models. This physics input is summarized here, for areas such as hard subprocesses, initial- and final-state parton showers, underlying events and beam remnants, fragmentation and decays, and much more. Furthermore, extensive information is provided on all program elements: subroutines and functions, switches and parameters, and particle and process data. This should allow the user to tailor the generation task to the topics of interest.},

The number of parameters to be determined in the spatial alignment of the 2198 sensor modules of the ITS is about 13,000. The target alignment precision is well below 10 micron in some cases (pixels). The sources of alignment information include survey measurements, and the reconstructed tracks from cosmic rays and from proton-proton collisions. The main track-based alignment method uses the Millepede global approach. An iterative local method was developed and used as well. We present the results obtained for the ITS alignment using about 10{\textasciicircum}5 charged tracks from cosmic rays that have been collected during summer 2008, with the ALICE solenoidal magnet switched off.},

Several distributions show significant improvements with respect to the current defaults, for both ee and pp collisions, though we emphasize that interesting discrepancies remain in particular for strange particles and baryons.

The measurements are performed in multiple centrality intervals at mid-rapidity ({\textbar}\$y\${\textbar}{\textless}0.5) in the transverse-momentum ranges 0.3 {\textless} \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ {\textless} 5 GeV/\$c\$ for the K*(892)\${\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$ and 0.5 {\textless} \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ {\textless} 5 GeV/\$c\$ for the \${\textbackslash}Phi\$(1020). The yields of K*(892)\${\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$ are suppressed in central Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp and peripheral Pb-Pb collisions (perhaps due to rescattering of its decay products in the hadronic medium), while the longer lived \${\textbackslash}Phi\$(1020) meson is not suppressed. These particles are also used as probes to study the mechanisms of particle production. The shape of the \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ distribution of the \${\textbackslash}Phi\$(1020) meson, but not its yield, is reproduced fairly well by hydrodynamic models for central Pb-Pb collisions. In central Pb-Pb collisions at low and intermediate \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$, the p/\${\textbackslash}Phi\$(1020) ratio is flat in \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$, while the p/\${\textbackslash}pi\$ and \${\textbackslash}Phi\$(1020)/\${\textbackslash}pi\$ ratios show a pronounced increase and have similar shapes to each other. These results indicate that the shapes of the \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ distributions of these particles in central Pb-Pb collisions are determined predominantly by the particle masses and radial flow. Finally, \${\textbackslash}Phi\$(1020) production in Pb-Pb collisions is enhanced, with respect to the yield in pp collisions and the yield of charged pions, by an amount similar to the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$ and \${\textbackslash}Xi\$.},

	abstract = {Measurements of identified hadrons as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions enable a search for the onset of collective effects in small collision systems. With such measurements, it is possible to study the mechanisms that determine the shapes of hadron transverse momentum (\$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{T\}\}\$) spectra, to search for possible modifications of the yields of short-lived hadronic resonances due to scattering effects in the hadron-gas phase, and to investigate different explanations for the multiplicity evolution of strangeness production provided by phenomenological models. In this paper, these topics are addressed through measurements of the \${\textbackslash}rm\{K\}{\textasciicircum}\{*\}(892){\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}phi(1020)\$ mesons at midrapidity in pp collisions at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}\$ = 13 TeV as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity. The results include the \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{T\}\}\$ spectra, \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{T\}\}\$-integrated yields, mean transverse momenta, and the ratios of the yields of these resonances to those of longer-lived hadrons. Comparisons with results from other collision systems and energies, as well as predictions from phenomenological models, are also discussed.},

The transverse mass and \$x\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{T\}\}{\textbackslash}equiv2p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{T\}\}/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}\$ scaling properties of hadron production are also studied. As the collision energy increases from \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}\$ = 7 to 13 TeV, the yields of non- and single-strange hadrons normalized to the pion yields remain approximately constant as a function of \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}\$, while ratios for multi-strange hadrons indicate enhancements.

The production rates of \${\textbackslash}rm\{K\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\}\_\{S\}\$, \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$, \${\textbackslash}Xi\$, and \${\textbackslash}Omega\$ increase with the multiplicity faster than what is reported for inclusive charged particles. The increase is found to be more pronounced for hadrons with a larger strangeness content. Possible auto-correlations between the charged particles and the strange hadrons are evaluated by measuring the event-activity with charged particle multiplicity estimators covering different pseudorapidity regions. When comparing to lower energy results, the yields of strange hadrons are found to depend only on the mid-rapidity charged particle multiplicity. Several features of the data are reproduced qualitatively by general purpose QCD Monte Carlo models that take into account the effect of densely-packed QCD strings in high multiplicity collisions. However, none of the tested models reproduce the data quantitatively. This work corroborates and extends the ALICE findings on strangeness production in proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV.},

	abstract = {This Letter presents the first experimental evidence of the attractive strong interaction between a proton and a \${\textbackslash}phi\$ meson. The result is obtained from two-particle correlations of combined p-\${\textbackslash}phi {\textbackslash}oplus {\textbackslash}overline\{{\textbackslash}rm \{p\}\}\$-\${\textbackslash}phi\$ pairs measured in high-multiplicity pp collisions at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}{\textasciitilde}={\textasciitilde}13\$ TeV by the ALICE collaboration. The spin-averaged scattering length and effective range of the p-\${\textbackslash}phi\$ interaction are extracted from the fully corrected correlation function employing the Lednick{\textbackslash}'y-Lyuboshits approach. In particular, the imaginary part of the scattering length vanishes within uncertainties, indicating that inelastic processes do not play a prominent role for the p-\${\textbackslash}phi\$ interaction. These data demonstrate that the interaction is dominated by elastic p-\${\textbackslash}phi\$ scattering. Furthermore, an analysis employing phenomenological Gaussian- and Yukawa-type potentials is conducted. Under the assumption of the latter, the N-\${\textbackslash}phi\$ coupling constant is found to be \$g\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{N\}-{\textbackslash}phi\} = 0.14{\textbackslash}pm 0.03{\textbackslash},({\textbackslash}mathrm\{stat.\}){\textbackslash}pm 0.02{\textbackslash},({\textbackslash}mathrm\{syst.\})\$.

The pPb data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 inverse nanobarns, were collected during the 2013 LHC pPb run at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV by the CMS experiment. A sample of semi-peripheral PbPb collision data at sqrt(s[NN])= 2.76 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.5 inverse microbarns and covering a similar range of particle multiplicities as the pPb data, is also analyzed for comparison. The six- and eight-particle cumulant and the Lee-Yang zeros methods are used to extract the v2 coefficients, extending previous studies of two- and four-particle correlations. For both the pPb and PbPb systems, the v2 values obtained with correlations among more than four particles are consistent with previously published four-particle results. These data support the interpretation of a collective origin for the previously observed long-range (large Delta[eta]) correlations in both systems. The ratios of v2 values corresponding to correlations including different numbers of particles are compared to theoretical predictions that assume a hydrodynamic behavior of a pPb system dominated by fluctuations in the positions of participant nucleons. These results provide new insights into the multi-particle dynamics of collision systems with a very small overlapping region.},

Short-range correlations in Delta(eta), which are studied in minimum bias events, are characterized using a simple "independent cluster" parametrization in order to quantify their strength (cluster size) and their extent in eta (cluster decay width). Long-range azimuthal correlations are studied differentially as a function of charged particle multiplicity and particle transverse momentum using a 980 inverse nb data set at 7 TeV. In high multiplicity events, a pronounced structure emerges in the two-dimensional correlation function for particle pairs with intermediate transverse momentum of 1-3 GeV/c, 2.0{\textless} {\textbar}Delta(eta){\textbar} {\textless}4.8 and Delta(phi) near 0.

	abstract = {At sufficiently high temperature and energy density, nuclear matter undergoes a transition to a phase in which quarks and gluons are not confined: the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) [1]. Such an extreme state of strongly-interacting QCD (Quantum Chromo-Dynamics) matter is produced in the laboratory with high-energy collisions of heavy nuclei, where an enhanced production of strange hadrons is observed [2-6]. Strangeness enhancement, originally proposed as a signature of QGP formation in nuclear collisions [7], is more pronounced for multi-strange baryons. Several effects typical of heavy-ion phenomenology have been observed in high-multiplicity proton-proton (pp) collisions [8,9]. Yet, enhanced production of multi-strange particles has not been reported so far. Here we present the first observation of strangeness enhancement in high-multiplicity pp collisions. We find that the integrated yields of strange and multi-strange particles relative to pions increases significantly with the event charged-particle multiplicity. The measurements are in remarkable agreement with p-Pb collision results [10,11] indicating that the phenomenon is related to the final system created in the collision. In high-multiplicity events strangeness production reaches values similar to those observed in Pb-Pb collisions, where a QGP is formed.},

	abstract = {The multiplicity dependence of the pseudorapidity density of charged particles in proton-proton (pp) collisions at centre-of-mass energies \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}\$ = 5.02, 7 and 13 TeV measured by ALICE is reported. The analysis relies on track segments measured in the midrapidity range (\${\textbar}{\textbackslash}eta{\textbar} {\textless} 1.5\$). Results are presented for inelastic events having at least one charged particle produced in the pseudorapidity interval \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}eta{\textbar}{\textless}1\$ (\${\textbackslash}mathrm\{INEL\}\_\{{\textgreater}0\}\$). The multiplicity dependence of the pseudorapidy density of charged particles is measured with mid and forward rapidity multiplicity estimators, the latter being less affected by autocorrelations. A detailed comparison with predictions from the PYTHIA 8 and EPOS LHC event generators is also presented. Both generators provide a good description of the data.},

	abstract = {ALICE is a general-purpose heavy-ion experiment designed to study the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark–gluon plasma in nucleus–nucleus collisions at the LHC. It currently involves more than 900 physicists and senior engineers, from both the nuclear and high-energy physics sectors, from over 90 institutions in about 30 countries. The ALICE detector is designed to cope with the highest particle multiplicities above those anticipated for Pb–Pb collisions (dNch/dy up to 8000) and it will be operational at the start-up of the LHC. In addition to heavy systems, the ALICE Collaboration will study collisions of lower-mass ions, which are a means of varying the energy density, and protons (both pp and pA), which primarily provide reference data for the nucleus–nucleus collisions. In addition, the pp data will allow for a number of genuine pp physics studies. The detailed design of the different detector systems has been laid down in a number of Technical Design Reports issued between mid-1998 and the end of 2004. The experiment is currently under construction and will be ready for data taking with both proton and heavy-ion beams at the start-up of the LHC. Since the comprehensive information on detector and physics performance was last published in the ALICE Technical Proposal in 1996, the detector, as well as simulation, reconstruction and analysis software have undergone significant development. The Physics Performance Report (PPR) provides an updated and comprehensive summary of the performance of the various ALICE subsystems, including updates to the Technical Design Reports, as appropriate. The PPR is divided into two volumes. Volume I, published in 2004 (CERN/LHCC 2003-049, ALICE Collaboration 2004 J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 30 1517–1763), contains in four chapters a short theoretical overview and an extensive reference list concerning the physics topics of interest to ALICE, the experimental conditions at the LHC, a short summary and update of the subsystem designs, and a description of the offline framework and Monte Carlo event generators. The present volume, Volume II, contains the majority of the information relevant to the physics performance in proton–proton, proton–nucleus, and nucleus–nucleus collisions. Following an introductory overview, Chapter 5 describes the combined detector performance and the event reconstruction procedures, based on detailed simulations of the individual subsystems. Chapter 6 describes the analysis and physics reach for a representative sample of physics observables, from global event characteristics to hard processes.},

These correlations are studied using the balance function that probes the charge creation time and the development of collectivity in the produced system. The dependence of the balance function on the event multiplicity as well as on the trigger and associated particle transverse momentum (\$p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}\$) in pp, p-Pb, and Pb-Pb collisions at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{NN\}\}\} = 7\$, 5.02, and 2.76 TeV, respectively, are presented. In the low transverse momentum region, for \$0.2 {\textless} p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\} {\textless} 2.0\$ GeV/\$c\$, the balance function becomes narrower in both \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}Delta\}{\textbackslash}eta\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}Delta\}{\textbackslash}varphi\$ directions in all three systems for events with higher multiplicity. The experimental findings favor models that either incorporate some collective behavior (e.g. AMPT) or different mechanisms that lead to effects that resemble collective behavior (e.g. PYTHIA8 with color reconnection). For higher values of transverse momenta the balance function becomes even narrower but exhibits no multiplicity dependence, indicating that the observed narrowing with increasing multiplicity at low \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}\$ is a feature of bulk particle production.},
